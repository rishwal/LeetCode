# Problem: Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk (LeetCode 1894)

## Problem Statement
There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number `0`, then the student number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number `0` again.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to replace the chalk.

Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.

### Example 1:
```
Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25
Output: 1
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.
Student number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
```

### Constraints:
- `chalk.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= chalk[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int ChalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long totalChalkNeeded = 0;
        foreach (int studentChalkUse in chalk) {
            totalChalkNeeded += studentChalkUse;
        }
        
        int remainingChalk = (int)(k % totalChalkNeeded);
        
        for (int studentIndex = 0; studentIndex < chalk.Length; studentIndex++) {
            if (remainingChalk < chalk[studentIndex]) {
                return studentIndex;
            }
            remainingChalk -= chalk[studentIndex];
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
}
```

## Explanation:
1. **Calculate Total Chalk Requirement**:
   - First, sum up all the chalk required by each student to calculate the total chalk needed in one full round. 

2. **Reduce k using Modulo**:
   - Since the process repeats every round, we only need to know the remainder when `k` is divided by the total chalk needed. This helps in reducing the problem size significantly.

3. **Determine the Student**:
   - Iterate through the students again, decrementing the remaining chalk as each student uses their required amount. The first student who requires more chalk than what remains will be the one to replace the chalk.

## Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The solution iterates through the `chalk` array twice, once for summing and once for determining the student.

## Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
