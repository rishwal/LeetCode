# 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

## Problem Description

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes where each node in the tree has `node.val` coins. There are `n` coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= Node.val <= n`
- The sum of all `Node.val` is `n`.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. The idea is to balance the coins by calculating the excess coins at each node and recursively balancing the tree. The number of moves is calculated based on the absolute value of the excess coins at each step.

### Steps:

1. **Define a DFS function:** This function will calculate the excess coins for each node and add the absolute value of the excess to the moves counter.
2. **Post-order traversal:** Traverse the tree in a post-order manner (left, right, root) to ensure that we are processing the leaf nodes first.
3. **Calculate moves:** For each node, calculate the number of moves needed to balance the coins by summing the absolute values of the left and right excesses.
4. **Return the total moves:** After the DFS traversal, the total moves required to balance the tree will be stored in the `moves` variable.

### Code

```csharp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */

public class Solution {
    private int moves = 0;

    private int Dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        int leftExcess = Dfs(node.left);
        int rightExcess = Dfs(node.right);
        
        moves += Math.Abs(leftExcess) + Math.Abs(rightExcess);
        
        // Return the total excess coins at this node
        return node.val + leftExcess + rightExcess - 1;
    }

    public int DistributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        Dfs(root);
        return moves;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Case:** If the current node is `null`, return `0` indicating no excess coins.
2. **Recursive Case:** 
   - Recursively process the left and right children to get their excess coins.
   - Calculate the total excess coins at the current node.
   - Add the absolute values of the left and right excesses to the `moves` counter.
3. **Return the Excess:** Return the total excess coins at the current node to its parent.

This solution ensures that we efficiently balance the coins with the minimum number of moves required.
