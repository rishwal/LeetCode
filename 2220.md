# 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number

## Problem Description

A bit flip of a number `x` is choosing a bit in the binary representation of `x` and flipping it from either `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert `start` to `goal`.

## Example 1:
Input: start = 10, goal = 7 Output: 3 Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:

Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111. It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

## Example 2:
Input: start = 3, goal = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:

Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100. It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

## Constraints:
- 0 <= start, goal <= 10^9

## Solution Explanation

### Key Idea:

1. **XOR Operation**: Perform XOR between `start` and `goal` to identify which bits differ. The bits that differ will result in `1`s in the XOR result.
2. **Counting Set Bits**: The number of `1`s in the XOR result tells how many bit flips are required to convert `start` to `goal`.

### Steps:
- XOR the `start` and `goal` to get the difference in bits.
- Count the number of `1`s in the XOR result.
- Return that count as the minimum number of bit flips.

### C# Solution:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
         // Perform XOR between start and goal to find differing bits
        int xorResult = start ^ goal;
        
        // Count the number of 1s in the XOR result
        return CountSetBits(xorResult);
    }

    // Helper function to count set bits (number of 1s) in an integer
    private int CountSetBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += n & 1;  // Check if the last bit is 1
            n >>= 1;         // Shift bits to the right
        }
        return count;
    }
}
Time Complexity:
XOR operation is O(1) since the numbers are bounded by 32 bits.
Counting the set bits is also O(1), so the overall time complexity is constant O(1).
