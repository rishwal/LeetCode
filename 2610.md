# Create 2D Array from Distinct Elements in nums

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, you need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

- The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
- Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
- The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.

Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]`  
**Output:** `[[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]`  
**Explanation:** We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- [1,3,4,2]
- [1,3]
- [1]
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer. It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `[[4,3,2,1]]`  
**Explanation:** All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public IList<IList<int>> FindMatrix(int[] nums) {
        List<List<int>> result = new List<List<int>>();

        foreach (int num in nums) {
            bool added = false;

            foreach (List<int> row in result) {
                if (!row.Contains(num)) {
                    row.Add(num);
                    added = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!added) {
                result.Add(new List<int> { num });
            }
        }

        return result.ToList<IList<int>>();
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Initialize an empty list `result` to store the rows of the 2D array.

2. **Iterating through `nums`:**
   - For each element `num` in `nums`, iterate through the existing rows in `result`.
   - Check if the current row contains the element `num`.
   - If not found, add the element `num` to the current row and set `added` to true.
   - If `num` is not added to any existing row, create a new row with `num` and add it to `result`.

3. **Result:** The final `result` is a 2D array containing distinct elements from `nums` with the minimum number of rows.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because, in the worst case, for each element in `nums`, we may need to iterate through all existing rows in `result` to check for duplicates.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is due to the space used to store the `result` list.
