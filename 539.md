# 539. Minimum Time Difference

## Problem Statement

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

### Example 1:

- **Input**: 
  ```plaintext
  timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output:

Example 2:
Input:
plaintext
Always show details

Copy code
timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output:

0
Constraints:
2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 10^4
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH
"
Solution
Approach:
Handling Edge Cases:

If the list contains more than 1440 time points (since there are only 1440 minutes in a day), there must be duplicates, so the minimum difference is 0.
Marking Time Points:

Create a boolean array of size 1440 to represent each minute of the day.
Convert each time point to its corresponding minute count since midnight and mark it in the boolean array.
Calculating Minimum Difference:

Traverse the boolean array to find the minimum difference between consecutive time points.
Handle the circular case by considering the difference between the first and last time points of the day.

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindMinDifference(IList<string> timePoints) {
        // If we have more than 1440 time points, there must be duplicates.
        if (timePoints.Count > 1440) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Step 1: Create a boolean array to represent each minute of the day
        bool[] timeSeen = new bool[1440];
        
        // Step 2: Convert each time to minutes since midnight and mark in the boolean array
        foreach (var time in timePoints) {
            int minutes = ConvertToMinutes(time);
            // If the same time already exists, return 0 (since duplicate times give min diff of 0)
            if (timeSeen[minutes]) {
                return 0;
            }
            timeSeen[minutes] = true;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Find the minimum difference
        int prevTime = -1; // Variable to keep track of previous time point
        int firstTime = -1; // First time point of the day
        int lastTime = -1; // Last time point of the day
        int minDifference = int.MaxValue;

        for (int i = 0; i < 1440; i++) {
            if (timeSeen[i]) {
                if (prevTime != -1) {
                    // Calculate the difference between consecutive times
                    minDifference = Math.Min(minDifference, i - prevTime);
                }
                prevTime = i;
                
                // Record the first and last time points
                if (firstTime == -1) {
                    firstTime = i;
                }
                lastTime = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Step 4: Handle the circular case (difference between the first and last time of the day)
        minDifference = Math.Min(minDifference, 1440 + firstTime - lastTime);
        
        return minDifference;
    }

    // Helper function to convert "HH:MM" to minutes since midnight
    private int ConvertToMinutes(string time) {
        int hours = int.Parse(time.Substring(0, 2));
        int minutes = int.Parse(time.Substring(3, 2));
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }
}
```
Explanation:
Boolean Array Representation:

We use a boolean array of size 1440 to mark which minutes of the day are represented by the time points.
Iterate and Calculate:

For each marked minute, we calculate the difference from the previous marked minute to find the minimum difference.
We also consider the circular nature of the clock (difference between the first and last marked minutes).
Edge Cases:

If there are more than 1440 time points, duplicates exist, so the minimum difference is 0.
Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of time points.
Space Complexity: O(1) (the boolean array size is constant, 1440). """
