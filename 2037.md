# Problem 2037: Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone

## Problem Statement
There are `n` seats and `n` students in a room. You are given an array `seats` of length `n`, where `seats[i]` is the position of the `i-th` seat. You are also given the array `students` of length `n`, where `students[j]` is the position of the `j-th` student.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

- Increase or decrease the position of the `i-th` student by 1 (i.e., moving the `i-th` student from position `x` to `x + 1` or `x - 1`).

Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.

Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.

### Example 1
- **Input:** `seats = [3, 1, 5]`, `students = [2, 7, 4]`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:**
  - The students are moved as follows:
    - The first student is moved from position `2` to position `1` using `1` move.
    - The second student is moved from position `7` to position `5` using `2` moves.
    - The third student is moved from position `4` to position `3` using `1` move.
  - In total, `1 + 2 + 1 = 4` moves were used.

### Example 2
- **Input:** `seats = [4, 1, 5, 9]`, `students = [1, 3, 2, 6]`
- **Output:** `7`
- **Explanation:**
  - The students are moved as follows:
    - The first student is not moved.
    - The second student is moved from position `3` to position `4` using `1` move.
    - The third student is moved from position `2` to position `5` using `3` moves.
    - The fourth student is moved from position `6` to position `9` using `3` moves.
  - In total, `0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7` moves were used.

### Example 3
- **Input:** `seats = [2, 2, 6, 6]`, `students = [1, 3, 2, 6]`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:**
  - The students are moved as follows:
    - The first student is moved from position `1` to position `2` using `1` move.
    - The second student is moved from position `3` to position `6` using `3` moves.
    - The third student is not moved.
    - The fourth student is not moved.
  - In total, `1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4` moves were used.

## Constraints
- `1 <= seats.length, students.length <= 100`
- `0 <= seats[i], students[i] <= 100`

## Solution

### Approach
1. **Sort the Arrays:** By sorting both `seats` and `students` arrays, we can ensure that each student moves to the nearest available seat, minimizing the total number of moves.
2. **Calculate Moves:** Iterate through the sorted arrays and calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements to get the total number of moves.

### Code
```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

public class Solution {
    public int MinMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        // Sort both arrays
        Array.Sort(seats);
        Array.Sort(students);

        int totalMoves = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total moves required
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.Length; i++) {
            totalMoves += Math.Abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }

        return totalMoves;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Sorting:** Sorting both `seats` and `students` arrays ensures that the closest positions are matched, thereby minimizing the total movement.
- **Calculation:** For each student, calculate the absolute difference from the corresponding seat and accumulate the total number of moves.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where `n` is the number of seats (or students).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are sorting the arrays in place and using a fixed amount of additional space for variables.
