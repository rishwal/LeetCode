# 713 Subarray Product Less Than K 🧮

## Question ❓
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

## Examples 📊
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0
```

## Constraints 🛑
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- 0 <= k <= 10^6

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int l = 0, r = 0, p = 1, res = 0;
        while (r < nums.Length)
        {
            p *= nums[r];
            while (p >= k && l <= r)
            {
                p /= nums[l];
                l++;
            }
            res += r - l + 1;
            r++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution uses a sliding window approach. It iterates through the array `nums` using two pointers `l` and `r` to define the subarray. The variable `p` calculates the product of elements in the current subarray. When the product exceeds or equals `k`, the left pointer `l` is moved to the right until the product is less than `k`. The number of subarrays with product less than `k` is then updated by adding the length of the current subarray `r - l + 1` to the result.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because both pointers `l` and `r` traverse the array once.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses only constant extra space, regardless of the input size.
