# 997. Find the Town Judge
## Problem
In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:
1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`. If a trust relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

## Example
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 1000
- 0 <= trust.length <= 10^4
- trust[i].length == 2
- All the pairs of trust are unique.
- ai != bi
- 1 <= ai, bi <= n

## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        // Dictionary to store trust count for each person
        Dictionary<int, int> trustCounts = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        
        // Initialize trust counts for all people
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            trustCounts[i] = 0;
        }
        
        // Update trust counts based on input trust relationships
        foreach (var pair in trust) {
            int trustingPerson = pair[0];
            int trustedPerson = pair[1];
            trustCounts[trustingPerson]--;
            trustCounts[trustedPerson]++;
        }
        
        // Check for the person who satisfies the conditions
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trustCounts[i] == n - 1) { // Trusted by everyone except themselves
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        // No town judge found
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of trust relationships.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of people.
