# Climbing Stairs

## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Solution

```javascript
var climbStairs = function (n) {
    if (n <= 2) {
        return n;
    }
    const arr = [1, 2];
    for (i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2];
    }
    return arr[arr.length - 1];
};
```

## Explanation

The function `climbStairs` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the number of distinct ways to climb the stairs. It uses a dynamic programming approach to build an array `arr` where `arr[i]` represents the number of ways to climb `i+1` stairs. The function returns the last element of this array, which contains the final result.
