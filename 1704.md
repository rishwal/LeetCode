# 1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike

**Difficulty: Easy**

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let `a` be the first half and `b` be the second half.

Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Notice that `s` contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if `a` and `b` are alike. Otherwise, return false.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.
```

**Constraints:**

- The length of the string `s` is even and in the range [2, 1000].
- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool HalvesAreAlike(string s)
    {
        int HalveCount = (int)Math.Floor(s.Length / 2.0);
        string s1 = s.Substring(0, HalveCount).ToLower();
        string s2 = s.Substring(HalveCount).ToLower();

        int count1 = 0;
        int count2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < HalveCount; i++)
        {
            if (s1[i] == 'a' || s1[i] == 'e' || s1[i] == 'i' || s1[i] == 'o' || s1[i] == 'u')
            {
                count1++;
            }

            if (s2[i] == 'a' || s2[i] == 'e' || s2[i] == 'i' || s2[i] == 'o' || s2[i] == 'u')
            {
                count2++;
            }
        }

        return count1 == count2;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution uses a straightforward approach to count vowels in each half of the string.
- The string `s` is split into two halves, and each half is converted to lowercase to simplify vowel comparison.
- Two separate counters (`count1` and `count2`) are used to keep track of the number of vowels in each half.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`.

## Why Use If Conditions Instead of HashSet or Array for Vowels

The solution directly checks for each vowel using individual `if` conditions to avoid unnecessary overhead of using a HashSet or an array. In this specific case, the number of vowels is limited, and the direct comparison with `if` conditions is more efficient, leading to a simpler and faster solution.
