## 79 Word Search üß©

### Question üéØ
Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

### Example 1 ‚úÖ

**Input:** 
```python
board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]
word = "ABCCED"
```

**Output:** 
`true`

### Example 2 ‚úÖ

**Input:** 
```python
board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]
word = "SEE"
```

**Output:** 
`true`

### Constraints üìè
- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

### Solution üí°

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool Exist(char[][] board, string word) {
        int rows = board.Length;
        int cols = board[0].Length;

        // Iterate through the board
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                // If the starting character matches, start exploring
                if (board[i][j] == word[0]) {
                    if (DFS(board, word, i, j, 0))
                        return true; // If found, return true
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If no matching word found, return false
        return false;
    }

    private bool DFS(char[][] board, string word, int row, int col, int index) {
        // If we've reached the end of the word, return true
        if (index == word.Length)
            return true;
        
        // Check if current position is out of bounds or the character does not match
        if (row < 0 || row >= board.Length || col < 0 || col >= board[0].Length || board[row][col] != word[index])
            return false;
        
        // Mark current position as visited by modifying it
        char temp = board[row][col];
        board[row][col] = ' ';
        
        // Explore in all four directions
        bool found = DFS(board, word, row + 1, col, index + 1) ||
                     DFS(board, word, row - 1, col, index + 1) ||
                     DFS(board, word, row, col + 1, index + 1) ||
                     DFS(board, word, row, col - 1, index + 1);
        
        // Restore the original character
        board[row][col] = temp;
        
        return found;
    }
}
```

### Explanation üìù
This solution performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from each cell of the grid to find the word. For each cell, it checks if the starting character matches the first character of the word. If it does, it recursively explores all four directions (up, down, left, right) to find the remaining characters of the word. If at any point, the word is found, it returns `true`. If no matching word is found, it returns `false`.

### Time Complexity ‚è∞
The time complexity of this solution is O(N * M * 4^L), where N and M are the dimensions of the board and L is the length of the word. This is because for each cell in the board, the algorithm explores at most 4 directions recursively to find the word.

### Space Complexity üöÄ
The space complexity is O(L), where L is the length of the word. This is because the recursive call stack can go up to the length of the word.
