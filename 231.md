# 💡231 Problem - Power of Two 🔢

## 📝 Problem Description
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two if there exists an integer x such that n == 2^x.

### Example:
**Input**: n = 1  
**Output**: true  
**Explanation**: 2^0 = 1  

**Input**: n = 16  
**Output**: true  
**Explanation**: 2^4 = 16  

**Input**: n = 3  
**Output**: false  

## ✨ Solution:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool IsPowerOfTwo(int n)  {
        return n < 1 ? false : (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }   
}
```

## 🧠 Explanation:
- The solution checks whether a number is a power of two by performing a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`.
- If `n` is a power of two, then `n & (n - 1)` will result in 0.
- If `n` is not a power of two, then `n & (n - 1)` will not be 0.
- If `n` is negative or zero, it cannot be a power of two, so the solution returns false for such cases.

## ⏱️ Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is O(1) as it involves only bitwise operations.

## 💾 Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as it does not use any extra space.
