# Problem: 3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array

You are given an array of integers `nums` and the head of a linked list. The task is to return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value existing in the `nums` array.

### Solution

The solution involves:
1. Storing the elements of `nums` in a `HashSet` for fast lookups.
2. Iterating through the linked list and skipping any node whose value exists in the `HashSet`.
3. Using a dummy node to handle edge cases like when the head of the list is removed.

### Approach

1. **HashSet for Fast Lookup**: We can utilize a `HashSet<int>` to store the elements in `nums`. This allows O(1) average-time complexity for checking whether a node's value exists in `nums`.

2. **Dummy Node**: To simplify the handling of the first node in the list (in case it needs to be removed), we use a dummy node that points to the head of the list.

3. **Traversal and Modification**: We traverse the list using two pointers: `current` and `current.next`. If `current.next.val` exists in the `HashSet`, we skip the node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`. Otherwise, we move `current` forward.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public ListNode ModifiedList(int[] nums, ListNode head) {
        // Step 1: Store nums in a HashSet for fast lookup
        HashSet<int> numSet = new HashSet<int>(nums);
        
        // Step 2: Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode current = dummy;
        
        // Step 3: Traverse the linked list
        while (current.next != null) {
            // Step 4: If the next node's value is in the HashSet, remove it
            if (numSet.Contains(current.next.val)) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, move to the next node
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        
        // Step 5: Return the modified list, starting from dummy.next
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **HashSet Construction**: We construct a `HashSet` from the `nums` array, which allows for O(1) time complexity when checking whether a nodeâ€™s value should be removed.

2. **Dummy Node**: The dummy node simplifies the code by eliminating special cases for the head of the list. It points to the head of the original list, and we return `dummy.next` as the new head after modification.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each node in the linked list, if its value is found in the `HashSet`, we skip it by modifying the `next` pointer of the previous node.
   - If the value is not in the `HashSet`, we simply move to the next node.

4. **Return**: After modifying the list, we return `dummy.next`, which represents the new head of the modified linked list.

### Time Complexity
- **O(m + n)**: 
  - O(m) to construct the `HashSet` from the `nums` array, where `m` is the length of `nums`.
  - O(n) to traverse the linked list and modify it, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Space Complexity
- **O(m)**: The space used by the `HashSet`, where `m` is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [4,5]
```

1. **HashSet**: `{1, 2, 3}`
2. Start from dummy node pointing to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3. Remove nodes `1`, `2`, and `3` since they are in the `HashSet`.
4. The modified list is `[4, 5]`.

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], head = [1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2,2,2]
```

1. **HashSet**: `{1}`
2. Remove nodes with value `1`, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.
