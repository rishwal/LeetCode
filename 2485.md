# 2485 Find the Pivot Integer 🔍

## Question ❓
Given a positive integer n, find the pivot integer x such that:

The sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Return the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, return -1. It is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot index for the given input.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: n = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 is the pivot integer since: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the pivot integer since: 1 = 1.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proved that no such integer exist.
```

## Constraints ✋
- 1 <= n <= 1000  

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int PivotInteger(int n) {
        double pivot = Math.Sqrt((n * (n + 1)) / 2);
        if(pivot - Math.Floor(pivot) == 0)
            return (int)pivot;
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution calculates the expected sum for a given range using the formula for the sum of consecutive integers. It then checks if the expected sum is an integer by verifying if its square root is a whole number. If it is, then that number is returned as the pivot integer; otherwise, -1 is returned.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is also O(1), as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of memory, regardless of the input size.
