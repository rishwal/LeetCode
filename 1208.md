# Problem 1208: Get Equal Substrings Within Budget
## Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`-th character of `s` to `i`-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return 0.

### Example 1
Input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "bcdf"
maxCost = 3
```
Output:
```
3
```
Explanation:
- "abc" of `s` can change to "bcd".
- That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.

### Example 2
Input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "cdef"
maxCost = 3
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- Each character in `s` costs 2 to change to character in `t`, so the maximum length is 1.

### Example 3
Input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "acde"
maxCost = 0
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
- `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current window of characters from `s` being considered.
   - Calculate the cost to change the current window from `s` to `t`.
   - Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and updating the `currentCost`.
   - If `currentCost` exceeds `maxCost`, shrink the window by moving the `start` pointer until `currentCost` is within `maxCost`.
   - Keep track of the maximum length of the valid window.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int EqualSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.Length;
        int start = 0;
        int currentCost = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < n; ++end) {
            currentCost += Math.Abs(s[end] - t[end]);

            while (currentCost > maxCost) {
                currentCost -= Math.Abs(s[start] - t[start]);
                ++start;
            }

            maxLength = Math.Max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity
- The algorithm processes each character of the strings exactly once, hence the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings `s` and `t`.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables `start`, `currentCost`, and `maxLength`.
