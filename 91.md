# LeetCode 91: Decode Ways

## Problem Description

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

- "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
- "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

## Example

### Input

```
s = "12"
```

### Output

```
2
```

Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

### Input

```
s = "226"
```

### Output

```
3
```

Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

### Input

```
s = "06"
```

### Output

```
0
```

Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").


# Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumDecodings(string s) {
        // Check if the input string is null or empty, or starts with '0'
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(s) || s[0] == '0')
        {
            return 0;
        }

        // Get the length of the input string
        int n = s.Length;

        // Initialize an array to store the number of ways to decode at each position
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

        // Base cases
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;

        // Iterate through the string starting from the second character
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        {
            // Extract one-digit and two-digit numbers
            int oneDigit = int.Parse(s.Substring(i - 1, 1));
            int twoDigits = int.Parse(s.Substring(i - 2, 2));

            // If the one-digit number is valid (1-9), update dp[i] based on the previous result
            if (oneDigit >= 1)
            {
                dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
            }

            // If the two-digit number is valid (10-26), update dp[i] based on the result two positions back
            if (twoDigits >= 10 && twoDigits <= 26)
            {
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
            }
        }

        // Return the result for the entire string
        return dp[n];
    }
}

```

## Approach Explanation

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can use an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the string `s` up to the `i`-th character.

The recurrence relation is as follows:

```
dp[i] = dp[i - 1]  // If s[i] is a valid single-digit number (1-9)
       + dp[i - 2]  // If s[i-1] and s[i] form a valid two-digit number (10-26)
```

The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`. We iterate through the string, updating the `dp` array based on the conditions mentioned above.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(n) as well. We use an additional array `dp` of size n+1 to store the number of ways at each position.
