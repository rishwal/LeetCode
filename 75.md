# Problem 75: Sort Colors

## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

### Example 1
- **Input:** `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`
- **Output:** `[0,0,1,1,2,2]`

### Example 2
- **Input:** `nums = [2,0,1]`
- **Output:** `[0,1,2]`

### Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

### Follow-up
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

## Solution

### Approach
We can solve this problem using the Dutch National Flag algorithm by Edsger W. Dijkstra. This algorithm is a one-pass algorithm that sorts the array in place with constant space complexity.

1. **Initialization:** Use three pointers:
   - `low` to track the boundary of zeros.
   - `mid` to traverse the array.
   - `high` to track the boundary of twos.

2. **Process:** Iterate through the array with the `mid` pointer:
   - If `nums[mid] == 0`: Swap `nums[low]` and `nums[mid]`, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid] == 1`: Just increment `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid] == 2`: Swap `nums[mid]` and `nums[high]`, then decrement `high` (do not increment `mid`).

This approach ensures that all zeros are moved to the beginning, all ones are in the middle, and all twos are moved to the end in a single pass.

### Code
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public void SortColors(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        int high = nums.Length - 1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                Swap(nums, low, mid);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else { // nums[mid] == 2
                Swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }

    private void Swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization:** Set `low = 0`, `mid = 0`, and `high = nums.Length - 1`.
- **Iteration:** Traverse the array with the `mid` pointer:
  - **Case `0`:** Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[low]` to move zero to the front and increment both `low` and `mid`.
  - **Case `1`:** Just increment `mid` as the element is already in the correct position.
  - **Case `2`:** Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[high]` to move the two to the end and decrement `high`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant space as we are not using any extra data structures.

This solution effectively sorts the array in a single pass with constant space, satisfying the problem constraints and follow-up requirements.
