# 2413 Smallest Even Multiple

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and `n`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
```

## Solution

```javascript
var smallestEvenMultiple = n => n % 2 ? n * 2 : n;
```

## Explanation

The `smallestEvenMultiple` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and `n`. The logic used is a ternary operator: if `n` is odd (`n % 2` is non-zero), then the function returns `n * 2`, otherwise, it returns `n`. This is based on the observation that if `n` is even, then `n` itself is the smallest multiple of both 2 and `n`, and if `n` is odd, then `n * 2` is the smallest multiple.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as the execution time does not depend on the input size.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), as the function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
