# 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

### Example

```plaintext
Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".

Example 3:

Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
   public string FirstPalindrome(string[] words)
{
    foreach (string word in words)
    {
        if (isPalindrome(word))
            return word;
    }

    return "";
}


public static bool isPalindrome(string s)
{
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.Length - 1;

    while (left < right)
    {
        if (s[left] != s[right])
        {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;

    }

    return true;
}
}
```

## Explanation


- The solution uses a method isPalindrome to check if a given string is a palindrome.
- The FirstPalindrome method iterates through the array of words and returns the first palindromic string it encounters, using the isPalindrome method.
- If no palindromic string is found, it returns an empty string.
