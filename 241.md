# 241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses

## Problem Statement

Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. The answer may be returned in any order.

The test cases are generated such that:
- The output values fit in a 32-bit integer.
- The number of different results does not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `expression = "2-1-1"`
- **Output:** `[0, 2]`
- **Explanation:**
  - `((2-1)-1) = 0`
  - `(2-(1-1)) = 2`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `expression = "2*3-4*5"`
- **Output:** `[-34, -14, -10, -10, 10]`
- **Explanation:**
  - `(2*(3-(4*5))) = -34`
  - `((2*3)-(4*5)) = -14`
  - `((2*(3-4))*5) = -10`
  - `(2*((3-4)*5)) = -10`
  - `(((2*3)-4)*5) = 10`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= expression.length <= 20`
- `expression` consists of digits and the operators '+', '-', and '*'.
- All integer values in the input expression are in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Solution

The key idea is to divide the expression into smaller parts recursively, compute the results for these parts, and then combine the results using the operators. This approach uses the concept of "divide and conquer."

### Approach
1. **Recursive Subdivision:** 
   - Iterate through the expression to find operators.
   - For each operator, divide the expression into two parts: left and right.
   - Recursively compute all possible results for both parts.
2. **Combination of Results:**
   - For each pair of results from the left and right subexpressions, apply the operator and store the result.
3. **Base Case:**
   - If the expression contains only a number, return it as a single-element list.

### Code
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public IList<int> DiffWaysToCompute(string expression) {
        IList<int> res = new List<int>();
        for (int i = 0; i < expression.Length; i++) {
            char oper = expression[i];
            if (oper == '+' || oper == '-' || oper == '*') {
                // Split the expression into two parts
                IList<int> s1 = DiffWaysToCompute(expression.Substring(0, i));
                IList<int> s2 = DiffWaysToCompute(expression.Substring(i + 1));
                
                // Combine the results of the two parts using the operator
                foreach (int a in s1) {
                    foreach (int b in s2) {
                        if (oper == '+') res.Add(a + b);
                        else if (oper == '-') res.Add(a - b);
                        else if (oper == '*') res.Add(a * b);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // If no operator was found, the expression is a single number
        if (res.Count == 0) res.Add(Int32.Parse(expression));
        return res;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** Exponential, because the solution recursively explores all possible ways to partition the expression. In the worst case, it is approximately `O(2^n)` where `n` is the number of operators in the expression.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also high due to the recursive call stack and the storage of intermediate results.

### Explanation
1. **Recursive Breakdown:** The solution uses a recursive function to split the expression at every operator. It then calculates all possible results for each partition.
2. **Operator Handling:** For each operator, it divides the expression into two subexpressions (`s1` and `s2`), recursively computes the results of these subexpressions, and combines them using the current operator.
3. **Base Case:** If no operator is found in the expression (meaning it's just a number), it's parsed and added to the result list.

### Example Walkthrough
- **Example 1:** `expression = "2-1-1"`
  - The expression can be split into:
    1. `"2-1"` and `"1"` → `((2-1)-1) = 0`
    2. `"2"` and `"1-1"` → `(2-(1-1)) = 2`
  - Output: `[0, 2]`
  
- **Example 2:** `expression = "2*3-4*5"`
  - Possible groupings:
    - `(2*(3-(4*5))) = -34`
    - `((2*3)-(4*5)) = -14`
    - `((2*(3-4))*5) = -10`
    - `(2*((3-4)*5)) = -10`
    - `(((2*3)-4)*5) = 10`
  - Output: `[-34, -14, -10, -10, 10]`
