# Leetcode Question 1637 Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        // Sort the points based on their x-coordinates
        Array.Sort(points, (a,b) => a[0].CompareTo(b[0]));

        int max = 0;

        // Iterate through the sorted points and find the maximum width
        for (int i = 1; i < points.Length; i++) {
            int width = points[i][0] - points[i-1][0];
            max = Math.Max(width, max);
        }

        // Return the maximum width
        return max;
     }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting:**
   - The points are sorted based on their x-coordinates using `Array.Sort` and a custom comparison delegate. Sorting ensures that consecutive points along the x-axis are close to each other.

2. **Finding Maximum Width:**
   - After sorting, the code iterates through the sorted points.
   - For each pair of consecutive points, it calculates the width of the vertical area between them by subtracting the x-coordinate of the previous point from the x-coordinate of the current point.
   - The maximum width encountered during the iteration is stored in the `max` variable.

3. **Return Result:**
   - The final result is the maximum width of the vertical area.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting operation, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), where 'n' is the number of points.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as the sorting is performed in-place, and the additional space required is constant, not dependent on the input size.
