# Number of Laser Beams in a Bank

## Problem Description

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while '1' means the cell has a security device.

There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

1. The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
2. For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]`  
**Output:** `8`  
**Explanation:** Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row. This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `bank = ["000","111","000"]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumberOfBeams(string[] bank) {
        int count = 0;
        int prevCount = 0;
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < bank.Length; i++) {
            count = bank[i].Count(c => c == '1');
            if (count >= 1) {
                res += prevCount * count;
                prevCount = count;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Initialize variables `count`, `prevCount`, and `res` to store the count of security devices in the current row, the count in the previous row, and the total number of laser beams, respectively.

2. **Iteration through Rows:** Iterate through each row in the bank.

3. **Counting Security Devices:** For each row, count the number of '1's (security devices).

4. **Updating Total Laser Beams:** If the count of security devices in the current row is greater than or equal to 1, update the total number of laser beams (`res`) by multiplying the count of the current row with the count of the previous row.

5. **Updating Previous Count:** Update the `prevCount` to be the count of the current row for the next iteration.

6. **Final Result:** Return the final result, representing the total number of laser beams in the bank.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the bank matrix.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), as the solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables.
