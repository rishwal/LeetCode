# LeetCode Question 2441: Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zeros, find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array. Return the positive integer `k`. If there is no such integer, return `-1`.

### Examples
#### Example 1:
```javascript
Input: nums = [-1,2,-3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the only valid k we can find in the array.
```

#### Example 2:
```javascript
Input: nums = [-1,10,6,7,-7,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Both 1 and 7 have their corresponding negative values in the array. 7 has a larger value.
```

#### Example 3:
```javascript
Input: nums = [-10,8,6,7,-2,-3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no single valid k; we return -1.
```

## My Answer

```javascript
const findMaxK = (s) => {
    const set = new Set(s);
    let out = -1;
    for (z of s) if (z > 0 && z > out && set.has(-z)) out = z;
    return out;
}
```

## Explanation

The logic of the solution is as follows:
- We create a `Set` from the given array `s` to efficiently check for the existence of values.
- We initialize the variable `out` to -1, which will store the result.
- We iterate through each element `z` in the array:
  - If `z` is greater than 0, greater than the current value of `out`, and its negation `-z` exists in the set, we update the value of `out` to `z`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `s`. The loop iterates through each element once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), as we create a set from the input array.
