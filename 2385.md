# 2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected

**Difficulty: Medium**

## Problem Description

You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and an integer `start`. At minute 0, an infection starts from the node with value `start`.

Each minute, a node becomes infected if:

- The node is currently uninfected.
- The node is adjacent to an infected node.

Return the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,5,3,null,4,10,6,9,2], start = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The following nodes are infected during:
- Minute 0: Node 3
- Minute 1: Nodes 1, 10, and 6
- Minute 2: Node 5
- Minute 3: Node 4
- Minute 4: Nodes 9 and 2
It takes 4 minutes for the whole tree to be infected so we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1], start = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: At minute 0, the only node in the tree is infected so we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- Each node has a unique value.
- A node with a value of `start` exists in the tree.

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    private int res;
    
    public int AmountOfTime(TreeNode root, int start) {
        int Search(int start, TreeNode node){
            if(node == null) return 0;

            int left = Search(start, node.left);
            int right = Search(start, node.right);

            if(node.val == start){
                res = Math.Max(left, right);
                return -1;
            }
            else if(left >= 0 && right >= 0)
                return Math.Max(left, right) + 1;

            res = Math.Max(res, Math.Abs(left - right));

            return Math.Min(left, right) - 1;
        }

        Search(start, root);
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree.
- The `Search` helper function is used to find the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.
- The function returns the time taken for the infection to reach the current node and updates the maximum time `res`.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.
