# Problem 523: Continuous Subarray Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a good subarray or `false` otherwise.

A good subarray is a subarray where:
- Its length is at least two, and
- The sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of `k`.

Note that:
- A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
- An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is always a multiple of `k`.

### Examples

#### Example 1
- **Input:** `nums = [23,2,4,6,7]`, `k = 6`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** `[2, 4]` is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.

#### Example 2
- **Input:** `nums = [23,2,6,4,7]`, `k = 6`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** `[23, 2, 6, 4, 7]` is a continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42. 42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.

#### Example 3
- **Input:** `nums = [23,2,6,4,7]`, `k = 13`
- **Output:** `false`

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 2^31 - 1`
- `1 <= k <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution

### Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we use the modulo operation and a dictionary to keep track of the cumulative sum remainders.

1. **Dictionary for Remainders:** We use a dictionary to store the remainder of the cumulative sum when divided by `k` and the corresponding index at which this remainder was first seen.
2. **Initial Setup:** Initialize the dictionary with a remainder of `0` at index `-1` to handle cases where the subarray starts from index `0`.
3. **Iterate through Array:** As we iterate through the array, we compute the cumulative sum and its remainder when divided by `k`.
4. **Check for Subarray:** If the same remainder is seen again, it means the subarray sum between these indices is a multiple of `k`. Ensure that the length of the subarray is at least 2.
5. **Return Result:** If such a subarray is found, return `true`; otherwise, continue processing. If no such subarray exists, return `false`.

### Code
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CheckSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Dictionary to store the remainder and the index at which it was seen
        Dictionary<int, int> remainderIndexMap = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        // Initialize with a remainder 0 at index -1 to handle the case where the subarray starts from index 0
        remainderIndexMap[0] = -1;

        int currentSum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            currentSum += nums[i];
            int remainder = currentSum % k;

            // Ensure the remainder is positive
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += k;
            }

            if (remainderIndexMap.ContainsKey(remainder)) {
                // Check if the subarray length is at least 2
                if (i - remainderIndexMap[remainder] > 1) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                // Store the index of the first occurrence of this remainder
                remainderIndexMap[remainder] = i;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Dictionary Usage:** The dictionary stores remainders of cumulative sums to detect if we have seen the same remainder before.
- **Positive Remainder:** The remainder is adjusted to ensure it is positive, which handles negative numbers correctly.
- **Check Subarray Length:** Ensures the length of the subarray is at least 2 by comparing the current index with the stored index.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(N, k)), for storing remainders in the dictionary.
