# 525 Contiguous Array 📏

## Question ❓
Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
```

## Constraints ✋
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        Dictionary<int, int> sumIndexMap = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        int maxLen = 0;
        int count = 0;

        // Initialize the map with 0 sum at index -1
        sumIndexMap.Add(0, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            // Increment count for 1 and decrement for 0
            count += (nums[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1;

            // If count is already in the map, calculate the current length
            if (sumIndexMap.ContainsKey(count)) {
                maxLen = Math.Max(maxLen, i - sumIndexMap[count]);
            }
            // Otherwise, add the count with its index
            else {
                sumIndexMap.Add(count, i);
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the sum and its corresponding index encountered while iterating through the binary array `nums`. It initializes the dictionary with a sum of 0 at index -1. For each element in `nums`, it increments the count by 1 if the element is 1 and decrements the count by 1 if the element is 0. If the current count is already present in the dictionary, it calculates the current length by subtracting the index of the count in the dictionary from the current index. It updates the maximum length if the current length is greater. If the current count is not present in the dictionary, it adds the count with its current index to the dictionary.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is also O(n), as the algorithm uses a dictionary to store the sum and its index.
