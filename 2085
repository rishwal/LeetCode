# LeetCode Solution: Count Common Words With One Occurrence

## Problem Description
Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, this solution returns the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

## Example

### Example 1:

Input: `words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]`

Output: `2`

Explanation:
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

### Example 2:

Input: `words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]`

Output: `0`

Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.

### Example 3:

Input: `words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]`

Output: `1`

Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the number of strings that appear exactly once in both arrays.
 * 
 * @param {string[]} words1 - The first array of strings.
 * @param {string[]} words2 - The second array of strings.
 * @returns {number} - The count of strings that appear exactly once in both arrays.
 */
var countWords = function (words1, words2) {
    let count = 0;
    const arr = [];

    for (x of words1) {
        if (words1.indexOf(x) === words1.lastIndexOf(x)) {
            if (words2.includes(x) && (words2.indexOf(x) === words2.lastIndexOf(x))) {
               count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};

// Example Usage
const words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"];
const words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"];
console.log(countWords(words1, words2));
```
