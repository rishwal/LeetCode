## üìù Question
You start with an initial power of `power`, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens given as an integer array `tokens`, where each `tokens[i]` denotes the value of the ith token. Your goal is to maximize the total score by strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways:

1. Face-up: If your current power is at least `tokens[i]`, you may play token i, losing `tokens[i]` power and gaining 1 score.
2. Face-down: If your current score is at least 1, you may play token i, gaining `tokens[i]` power and losing 1 score.

Return the maximum possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

## üåü Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: tokens = [100], power = 50
Output: 0
Explanation: Since your score is 0 initially, you cannot play the token face-down. You also cannot play it face-up since your power (50) is less than tokens[0] (100).
```

Example 2:
```
Input: tokens = [200,100], power = 150
Output: 1
Explanation: Play token1 (100) face-up, reducing your power to 50 and increasing your score to 1. There is no need to play token0, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is 1.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200
Output: 2
Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:
- Play token0 (100) face-up, reducing power to 100 and increasing score to 1.
- Play token3 (400) face-down, increasing power to 500 and reducing score to 0.
- Play token1 (200) face-up, reducing power to 300 and increasing score to 1.
- Play token2 (300) face-up, reducing power to 0 and increasing score to 2. The maximum score achievable is 2.
```

## üìö Explanation
This solution uses a greedy approach. It first sorts the tokens array. Then, it iterates through the tokens from both ends, maintaining the current power and score. At each step, it decides whether to play a token face-up or face-down based on the available power and score. The maximum score achieved during the process is returned as the result.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(NlogN), where N is the number of tokens. This is due to the sorting of the tokens array.

## üíæ Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. üöÄüìä
