# 2022 Problem: Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array (LeetCode 2022)

## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array `original`, and two integers, `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all the elements from `original`.

The elements from indices `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive) of `original` should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices `n` to `2 * n - 1` (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an `m x n` 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

### Example 1:
```
Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are 2 elements in original.
It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= original.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= original[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10^4`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[][] Construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
        int[][] result = new int[m][];
        
        // Check if it's possible to create an m x n 2D array from the original array
        if (m * n != original.Length) {
            return new int[0][];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            result[i] = new int[n];
            // Copy the elements from the original array into the 2D array
            Array.Copy(original, i * n, result[i], 0, n);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Explanation:
1. **Validation**: 
   - The first step is to check whether it's possible to fit the elements of the `original` array into an `m x n` 2D array. This is only possible if `m * n == original.Length`. If this condition is not met, we return an empty array.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - If the validation passes, we then construct the 2D array by iterating through each row and copying the relevant portion of the `original` array into the 2D array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m * n` does not equal the length of the `original` array, return an empty array.
   - The solution also handles cases where the `original` array is perfectly sized for the specified `m` and `n`.

## Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: The solution iterates through the entire `original` array exactly once to copy elements into the 2D array.

## Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: The space complexity is determined by the size of the resulting 2D array, which contains `m * n` elements.
