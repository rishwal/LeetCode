# 791 Custom Sort String üß©

## Question ‚ùì
You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in `order`, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property.

## Examples üåü
Example 1:
```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd" 
Output: "cbad" 
Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: order = "bcafg", s = "abcd" 
Output: "bcad" 
Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible. Following the order of appearance in order, "b", "c", and "a" from s should be arranged as "b", "c", "a". "d" can be placed at any position since it's not in order. The output "bcad" correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like "bacd" or "bcda" would also be valid, as long as "b", "c", "a" maintain their order.
```

## Solution üí°

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string CustomSortString(string order, string s) {
        int[] map = new int[26];
        foreach (char c in s) {
            map[c - 'a']++;
        }

        var result = new System.Text.StringBuilder();

        foreach (char c in order) {
            result.Append(new string(c, map[c - 'a']));
            map[c - 'a'] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            result.Append(new string((char)('a' + i), map[i]));
        }

        return result.ToString();
    }
}
```

## Explanation üìù
This solution iterates through the characters of `s` and counts the occurrences of each character using an integer array `map`. Then, it iterates through the characters of `order` and appends them to the result string according to their frequencies in `s`. Finally, it appends any remaining characters in `s` to the result string in their original order.

## Time Complexity ‚è∞
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through `s` to count the occurrences of each character and then iterate through `order` to build the result string.

## Space Complexity üöÄ
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since the size of the integer array `map` is constant (26) and does not depend on the size of the input strings.
