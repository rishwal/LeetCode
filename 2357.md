# Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts

## Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:

- Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in `nums`.
- Subtract `x` from every positive element in `nums`.

Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in `nums` equal to 0.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0, so no operations are needed.
```

## Solution

```javascript
var minimumOperations = function (nums) {
    let set = new Set(nums);
    return set.has(0) ? set.size - 1 : set.size;
};
```

## Explanation

The function `minimumOperations` takes an array of non-negative integers `nums` as input. It uses a `Set` to remove duplicates from the array, then checks if 0 is present in the set. If 0 is present, it returns the size of the set minus 1 (excluding 0), indicating the minimum number of operations needed to make every element zero. If 0 is not present, it returns the size of the set, indicating that all elements are already zero.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. The `Set` constructor and the `has` method both have O(1) time complexity on average.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because the `Set` is used to store unique elements from the array.
