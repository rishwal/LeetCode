# 719 Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance

The problem "Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance" can be efficiently solved using a combination of sorting and binary search, paired with a counting mechanism to determine how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to a given value.

### Solution Explanation

#### Problem Recap:
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, we need to find the k-th smallest distance between all pairs of numbers in the array. The distance between two numbers `a` and `b` is defined as `|a - b|`.

#### Approach:
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps us efficiently count pairs with distances less than or equal to a certain value.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to determine the k-th smallest distance. The search range will be between `0` (minimum possible distance) and `max(nums) - min(nums)` (maximum possible distance in the sorted array).
   - For each mid-point in the binary search, count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to `mid`.

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - To count the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to `mid`, iterate through the array. For each element at index `i`, find how many elements starting from index `i+1` have a difference with `nums[i]` less than or equal to `mid`. This can be done using a two-pointer technique.

4. **Determine the Result**:
   - If the count of pairs is greater than or equal to `k`, then the current `mid` could be the k-th smallest distance, so we move the upper bound of our binary search down.
   - If the count is less than `k`, then we move the lower bound of the binary search up.

#### Code Implementation:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int SmallestDistancePair(int[] nums, int k) {
        Array.Sort(nums);
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums[nums.Length - 1] - nums[0];

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (CountPairs(nums, mid) >= k) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    private int CountPairs(int[] nums, int maxDistance) {
        int count = 0;
        int j = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            while (j < nums.Length && nums[j] - nums[i] <= maxDistance) {
                j++;
            }
            count += j - i - 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search helps efficiently narrow down the possible distances that could be the k-th smallest.
   
2. **Counting Function**:
   - The `CountPairs` function determines how many pairs in the array have a distance less than or equal to a given value. The two-pointer technique within a sorted array allows us to do this in O(n) time.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
   - The binary search has a complexity of O(log(max_distance)).
   - Counting pairs within the array for a given mid-point takes O(n).
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + n log(max_distance)), which is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Example Walkthrough:
For `nums = [1,3,1]` and `k = 1`:
- After sorting, `nums = [1, 1, 3]`.
- We perform binary search to find the k-th smallest distance.
- The count of pairs with distance â‰¤ 0 is exactly 1 (the pair `(1,1)`), so the answer is `0`.
