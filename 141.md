# Linked List Cycle 🔄

## 👉🏼 Check out my Leetcode profile here : [leetcode.com/rishwal](https://leetcode.com/rishwal) 🔗

## Question ❓
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Solution 💡

```python []
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        return True

```
```javascript []
class Solution {
    hasCycle(head) {
        if (!head || !head.next)
            return false;
        
        let slow = head;
        let fast = head.next;
        
        while (slow !== fast) {
            if (!fast || !fast.next)
                return false;
            
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}

```

```Java []
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null)
            return false;
        
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null)
                return false;
            
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}

```
```csharp []
public class Solution {
    public bool HasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null)
            return false;
        
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null)
                return false;
            
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
``` C++ []
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next)
            return false;
        
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;
        
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (!fast || !fast->next)
                return false;
            
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};

```

## Explanation 📝
This solution uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect a cycle in a linked list. It starts with two pointers, slow and fast, initially pointing to the head of the list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer. If not, it will reach the end of the list.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because both pointers traverse the list at most once.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. 📊
