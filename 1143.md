# 1143 Longest Common Subsequence

## Problem Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde". A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

### Example 3:

**Input:** `text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
- text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LongestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2)
    {
        int[,] dp = new int[text1.Length + 1, text2.Length + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= text1.Length; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j <= text2.Length; j++)
            {
                if (text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1])
                {
                    dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    dp[i, j] = Math.Max(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[text1.Length, text2.Length];
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming:** The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest common subsequence.

2. **Table Initialization:** Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(text1.Length + 1) x (text2.Length + 1)`.

3. **Iteration:** Use a nested loop to iterate through each character of `text1` and `text2`.

4. **Comparison:** Compare the characters at the current positions `(i, j)` in `text1` and `text2`.

5. **Length Update:** If the characters are equal, update `dp[i, j]` to be `dp[i-1, j-1] + 1`. Otherwise, update it to be the maximum of `dp[i-1, j]` and `dp[i, j-1]`.

6. **Result:** The final result is stored in `dp[text1.Length, text2.Length]`, representing the length of the longest common subsequence.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(M*N), where M and N are the lengths of `text1` and `text2` respectively. This is because the algorithm fills in a 2D array of size `(text1.Length + 1) x (text2.Length + 1)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(M*N), where M and N are the lengths of `text1` and `text2` respectively. The algorithm uses a 2D array of this size to store intermediate results.
