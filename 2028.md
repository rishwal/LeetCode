# Problem: Find Missing Observations (LeetCode 2028)

## Problem Statement
You have observations of `n + m` 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. `n` of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of `m` rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the `n + m` rolls.

You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `m` where `rolls[i]` is the value of the `i`-th observation. You are also given the two integers `mean` and `n`.

Return an array of length `n` containing the missing observations such that the average value of the `n + m` rolls is exactly `mean`. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

### Example 1:
```
Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: 
The mean of all `n + m` rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: rolls = [1,5,6], mean = 3, n = 4
Output: [2,3,2,2]
Explanation:
The mean of all `n + m` rolls is (1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 7 = 3.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: rolls = [1,2,3,4], mean = 6, n = 4
Output: []
Explanation: 
It is impossible for the mean to be 6 no matter what the 4 missing rolls are.
```

### Constraints:
- `m == rolls.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`
- `1 <= rolls[i], mean <= 6`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[] MissingRolls(int[] rolls, int mean, int n) {
        // Step 1: Calculate the total sum for n + m rolls
        int m = rolls.Length;
        int totalSum = mean * (n + m);
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the sum of the known rolls
        int observedSum = 0;
        foreach (int roll in rolls) {
            observedSum += roll;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the missing sum for the n missing rolls
        int missingSum = totalSum - observedSum;
        
        // Step 4: Check if it's feasible to distribute the missing sum among n rolls
        if (missingSum < n || missingSum > 6 * n) {
            return new int[0]; // Impossible to distribute
        }
        
        // Step 5: Compute the base value for each missing roll
        int baseValue = missingSum / n;
        int remainder = missingSum % n;
        
        // Step 6: Prepare the result array
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Step 7: Distribute base values and the remainder
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Give each roll the base value, and distribute the remainder across the first few rolls
            result[i] = baseValue + (i < remainder ? 1 : 0);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Explanation:
1. **Total Sum Calculation**: 
   - The total sum of all `n + m` dice rolls can be computed as `totalSum = mean * (n + m)`.
   
2. **Known Observations Sum**: 
   - We sum all the known values from the `rolls` array (which contains `m` values).
   
3. **Missing Sum**: 
   - The difference between the `totalSum` and `observedSum` gives the missing sum that must be distributed across `n` dice.
   
4. **Feasibility Check**: 
   - The sum of the missing rolls must be at least `n` (if each roll is 1) and at most `6 * n` (if each roll is 6). If the `missingSum` falls outside this range, it is impossible to distribute the rolls, and we return an empty array.
   
5. **Distribute Missing Sum**: 
   - Divide the missing sum into base values and distribute any remainder across the rolls. Each roll will be either the base value or the base value plus one if there's a remainder to distribute.

6. **Return the Result**: 
   - After distributing the missing sum, return the resulting array of `n` values.

## Time Complexity:
- **O(m + n)**:
  - `O(m)` to calculate the sum of known rolls.
  - `O(n)` to construct the missing observations.

## Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: 
  - The space required to store the missing observations.
