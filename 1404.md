# Problem 1404: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

## Problem Statement
Given the binary representation of an integer as a string `s`, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

1. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
2. If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

### Examples

#### Example 1
- **Input:** `s = "1101"`
- **Output:** `6`
- **Explanation:**
  - "1101" corresponds to number 13 in decimal representation.
  - Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 to get 14.
  - Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 to get 7.
  - Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 to get 8.
  - Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 to get 4.
  - Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 to get 2.
  - Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 to get 1.

#### Example 2
- **Input:** `s = "10"`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:**
  - "10" corresponds to number 2 in decimal representation.
  - Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 to get 1.

#### Example 3
- **Input:** `s = "1"`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:**
  - The number is already 1, no steps are needed.

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `s` consists of characters '0' or '1'
- `s[0] == '1'`

## Solution

### Approach
The idea is to simulate the process of reducing the binary number to 1. We traverse the binary string from the end to the beginning. 

1. If the current bit is '0' and there's no carry, it means the number is even, and we simulate division by 2 by moving to the previous bit.
2. If the current bit is '1' or there is a carry, it means the number is odd, and we simulate adding 1. Adding 1 to a '1' creates a carry, affecting the next bit to the left.

We count the operations performed until we reduce the number to '1'.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumSteps(string s) {
        int length = s.Length;
        int carry = 0;
        int steps = 0;

        for (int i = length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            int currentBit = s[i] - '0';
            if (currentBit + carry == 1) {
                // It's odd, after adding 1 it will be even (create a carry)
                carry = 1;
                steps += 2; // Add 1 (making it 0) then divide by 2
            } else {
                // It's even, just divide by 2
                steps += 1; // Divide by 2
            }
        }

        // If there's a carry at the end, it means we performed an additional step
        return steps + carry;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space.
