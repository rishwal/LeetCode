## 205 Isomorphic Strings ✨

### Question 🎯
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

### Example 1 ✅

**Input:** 
s = "egg", t = "add"

**Output:** 
true

### Example 2 ❌

**Input:** 
s = "foo", t = "bar"

**Output:** 
false

### Constraints 📏
- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- t.length == s.length
- s and t consist of any valid ASCII character.

### Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        if (s.Length != t.Length)
            return false;

        Dictionary<char, char> map = new Dictionary<char, char>();
        HashSet<char> visited = new HashSet<char>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++) {
            char charS = s[i];
            char charT = t[i];

            // If s[i] has been mapped before, check if it's mapped to the same character in t
            if (map.ContainsKey(charS)) {
                if (map[charS] != charT)
                    return false;
            } else {
                // If s[i] hasn't been mapped, check if t[i] is already mapped to another character
                if (visited.Contains(charT))
                    return false;

                // Map s[i] to t[i]
                map[charS] = charT;
                visited.Add(charT);
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation 📝
This solution iterates through both strings `s` and `t` simultaneously. It uses a dictionary `map` to store the mapping between characters of `s` and `t`, and a set `visited` to keep track of characters that have been visited in `t`. If a character in `s` has been mapped before, it checks if it's mapped to the same character in `t`. If not, it returns `false`. If a character in `s` hasn't been mapped before, it checks if the corresponding character in `t` has been visited before. If yes, it returns `false`. Finally, if all mappings are valid, it returns `true`.

### Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. This is because we iterate through both strings once.

### Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. This is because we use a dictionary `map` and a set `visited` to store mappings and visited characters, respectively, which can contain at most n elements.
