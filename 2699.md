# 2699 Problem: Modify Graph Edge Weights (LeetCode 2699)

## Problem Statement
You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` with weight `wi`.

Some edges have a weight of `-1` (`wi = -1`), while others have a positive weight (`wi > 0`).

Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of `-1` by assigning them positive integer values in the range `[1, 2 * 10^9]` so that the shortest distance between the nodes `source` and `destination` becomes equal to an integer `target`. If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between `source` and `destination` equal to `target`, any of them will be considered correct.

Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from `source` to `destination` equal to `target`, or an empty array if it's impossible.

Note: You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial positive weights.

### Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[4,1,-1],[2,0,-1],[0,3,-1],[4,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 1, target = 5 Output: [[4,1,1],[2,0,1],[0,3,3],[4,3,1]] Explanation: The graph above shows a possible modification to the edges, making the distance from 0 to 1 equal to 5.

### Example 2:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,-1],[0,2,5]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6 Output: [] Explanation: The graph above contains the initial edges. It is not possible to make the distance from 0 to 2 equal to 6 by modifying the edge with weight -1. So, an empty array is returned.

### Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6 Output: [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,1]] Explanation: The graph above shows a modified graph having the shortest distance from 0 to 2 as 6.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `wi = -1 or 1 <= wi <= 10^7`
- `ai != bi`
- `0 <= source, destination < n`
- `source != destination`
- `1 <= target <= 10^9`
- The graph is connected, and there are no self-loops or repeated edges.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[][] ModifiedGraphEdges(int n, int[][] edges, int source, int destination, int target) {
        var adjacencyList = new List<(int, int)>[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjacencyList[i] = new List<(int, int)>();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.Length; i++) {
            int nodeA = edges[i][0], nodeB = edges[i][1];
            adjacencyList[nodeA].Add((nodeB, i));
            adjacencyList[nodeB].Add((nodeA, i));
        }

        var distances = new int[n, 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            distances[i, 0] = distances[i, 1] = i == source ? 0 : int.MaxValue;
        }

        RunDijkstra(adjacencyList, edges, distances, source, 0, 0);
        int difference = target - distances[destination, 0];
        if (difference < 0) return new int[0][];

        RunDijkstra(adjacencyList, edges, distances, source, difference, 1);
        if (distances[destination, 1] < target) return new int[0][];

        foreach (var edge in edges) {
            if (edge[2] == -1) edge[2] = 1;
        }
        return edges;
    }

    private void RunDijkstra(List<(int, int)>[] adjacencyList, int[][] edges, int[,] distances, int source, int difference, int run) {
        int n = adjacencyList.Length;
        var priorityQueue = new SortedSet<(int, int)>(Comparer<(int, int)>.Create((a, b) => a.Item2 != b.Item2 ? a.Item2.CompareTo(b.Item2) : a.Item1.CompareTo(b.Item1)));
        priorityQueue.Add((source, 0));
        distances[source, run] = 0;

        while (priorityQueue.Count > 0) {
            var (currentNode, currentDistance) = priorityQueue.Min;
            priorityQueue.Remove((currentNode, currentDistance));

            if (currentDistance > distances[currentNode, run]) continue;

            foreach (var (nextNode, edgeIndex) in adjacencyList[currentNode]) {
                int weight = edges[edgeIndex][2];
                if (weight == -1) weight = 1;

                if (run == 1 && edges[edgeIndex][2] == -1) {
                    int newWeight = difference + distances[nextNode, 0] - distances[currentNode, 1];
                    if (newWeight > weight) {
                        edges[edgeIndex][2] = weight = newWeight;
                    }
                }

                if (distances[nextNode, run] > distances[currentNode, run] + weight) {
                    priorityQueue.Remove((nextNode, distances[nextNode, run]));
                    distances[nextNode, run] = distances[currentNode, run] + weight;
                    priorityQueue.Add((nextNode, distances[nextNode, run]));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation:
Initialization:

Create an adjacency list to store all the edges.
Initialize a distances array to store the shortest distances from the source for two different runs of Dijkstra's algorithm.
First Dijkstra Run:

This run calculates the shortest paths considering all edges with -1 weight as 1.
Check Feasibility:

Calculate the difference between the target and the shortest path found in the first run.
If the difference is negative, return an empty array as it's impossible to achieve the target.
Second Dijkstra Run:

This run tries to adjust the weights of -1 edges to match the target distance.
Edge Adjustment:

Modify the weights of edges that initially had a weight of -1 and return the edges array.
Time Complexity:
O((V + E) * log(V)): The Dijkstra algorithm runs twice, and each run is O((V + E) * log(V)).
Space Complexity:
O(V + E): Storing the adjacency list and the distance arrays
