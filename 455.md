# LeetCode 455: Assign Cookies

## Problem Description

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with, and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

## Example

### Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content. You need to output 1.

### Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, You need to output 2.

## Solution

```javascript
var findContentChildren = function (g, s) {
    g.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    s.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let index = 0;
    let count = 0;

    while (index < s.length && count < g.length) {
        if (s[index] >= g[count]) {
            count++;
        }
        index++;
    }

    return count;
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Sorting Arrays:** Both the `g` (greed factors) and `s` (cookie sizes) arrays are sorted in ascending order. This is done to simplify the comparison process.

2. **Initialization:** Two pointers (`index` and `count`) are initialized. `index` is used to iterate through the `s` array (cookies), and `count` keeps track of the number of content children.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are cookies (`index < s.length`) and there are still children with unsatisfied greed (`count < g.length`).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current cookie size is greater than or equal to the current child's greed factor.
   - If true, it means the child can be satisfied with the current cookie. So, the `count` (content children) is incremented.
   - Regardless of whether the child is satisfied or not, the `index` is incremented to move to the next cookie.

4. **Final Result:** The function returns the final count, which represents the maximum number of content children.

This algorithm takes advantage of the sorted order of arrays to efficiently match cookies with children, starting from the smallest greed factor and cookie size. The goal is to maximize the number of content children.
## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the maximum of the lengths of `g` and `s`. This is due to the sorting operation.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and variables.
