# 885. Spiral Matrix III

## Problem Statement

You start at the cell `(rStart, cStart)` of a `rows x cols` grid facing east. The northwest corner is at the first row and column in the grid, and the southeast corner is at the last row and column.

You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. Whenever you move outside the grid's boundary, you continue your walk outside the grid but may return to the grid boundary later. Eventually, you will reach all `rows * cols` spaces of the grid.

Return an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited them.

### Example 1

**Input**: rows = 1, cols = 4, rStart = 0, cStart = 0

**Output**: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]

### Example 2

**Input**: rows = 5, cols = 6, rStart = 1, cStart = 4

**Output**: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]

### Constraints

- 1 <= rows, cols <= 100
- 0 <= rStart < rows
- 0 <= cStart < cols

## Solution

The solution involves walking in a spiral pattern from the starting position, using direction vectors to guide the movement. We adjust the direction and step length as necessary to achieve the spiral pattern and collect coordinates visited in the specified order.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[][] SpiralMatrixIII(int rows, int cols, int rStart, int cStart) {
        // Direction vectors: right, down, left, up
        int[][] directions = new int[][] {
            new int[] {0, 1},   // Right
            new int[] {1, 0},   // Down
            new int[] {0, -1},  // Left
            new int[] {-1, 0}   // Up
        };
        
        int totalCells = rows * cols;
        int[][] result = new int[totalCells][];
        int x = rStart, y = cStart;
        int direction = 0; // Start by moving right
        int steps = 1; // Initial steps in the current direction
        int index = 0;
        
        result[index++] = new int[] {x, y};
        
        while (index < totalCells) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) { // Two moves in each step increase cycle
                for (int j = 0; j < steps; j++) {
                    x += directions[direction][0];
                    y += directions[direction][1];
                    if (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols) {
                        result[index++] = new int[] {x, y};
                    }
                }
                direction = (direction + 1) % 4; // Change direction
            }
            steps++; // Increase steps after completing two direction moves
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Direction Vectors**: Define the movement in four directions (right, down, left, up).
- **Result Array**: Store the coordinates visited in the order.
- **Main Loop**: Continue until all cells are visited.
- **Direction Changes**: Change direction after completing the required steps.
- **Steps Increment**: Increase the number of steps after two direction changes.

### Examples

#### Example 1

For `rows = 1`, `cols = 4`, `rStart = 0`, `cStart = 0`:
- The function starts at `(0, 0)` and moves right, covering all cells in the single row.
- Hence, the function returns `[[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]`.

#### Example 2

For `rows = 5`, `cols = 6`, `rStart = 1`, `cStart = 4`:
- The function starts at `(1, 4)` and follows the spiral pattern to cover all cells.
- Hence, the function returns `[[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(rows * cols), as each cell is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(rows * cols), for storing the coordinates of each cell visited.

This approach ensures that all cells in the grid are visited in the required spiral order.
