## Description
Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

### Example 1:
```
Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: left = 0, right = 0
Output: 0
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: left = 1, right = 2147483647
Output: 0
```

## Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public int RangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int shift = 0;
        
        // Find the common prefix (common bits) of left and right
        while (left < right) {
            left >>= 1; // Right shift left
            right >>= 1; // Right shift right
            shift++; // Count the number of shifts needed to make left and right equal
        }
        
        // Shift left back to its original position
        return left << shift;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- We initialize a variable `shift` to keep track of the number of shifts needed to align the common prefix of `left` and `right`.
- We iterate through a loop until `left` and `right` are equal, shifting both `left` and `right` to the right by 1 bit in each iteration.
- For each iteration, we increment the `shift` variable to count the number of shifts.
- After the loop, we shift `left` back to its original position by left-shifting it by `shift` bits and return the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the difference between `left` and `right`. This is because we are performing bitwise shifting until `left` and `right` become equal.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
