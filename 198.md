# 198. House Robber

**Approach: Dynamic Programming**

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Example

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`  
Output: `12`  
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9), and rob house 5 (money = 1).  
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

## Solution in C#:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int Rob(int[] nums) {
        int robWithCurr=0,robWithoutCurr=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.Length;i++)
        {
            int newRobWithCurr=robWithoutCurr+nums[i];
            robWithoutCurr = Math.Max(robWithoutCurr, robWithCurr);
            robWithCurr = newRobWithCurr;
        }
        return Math.Max(robWithCurr,robWithoutCurr);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Dynamic Programming:

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.

### Variables:

- `robWithCurr`: Represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed including the current house.
- `robWithoutCurr`: Represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed excluding the current house.

### Iterating Through Houses:

The algorithm iterates through the array of houses and calculates the maximum amount of money that can be robbed for each house.

### Update Variables:

For each house, the algorithm calculates the new `robWithCurr` value by adding the money from the current house and the `robWithoutCurr` value. Then, it updates the `robWithoutCurr` value with the maximum value between `robWithoutCurr` and `robWithCurr`. Finally, it updates the `robWithCurr` value with the newly calculated value.

### Final Result:

The final result is the maximum amount of money that can be robbed, which is the maximum value between `robWithCurr` and `robWithoutCurr`.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of houses. The algorithm iterates through the array of houses exactly once, performing constant-time operations at each step.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), which means it uses constant space. The algorithm only uses a constant number of variables (`robWithCurr` and `robWithoutCurr`) regardless of the input size, making it efficient in terms of space usage.
