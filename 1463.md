# 1463. Cherry Pickup II
‚≠ê Check out my leetcode repo, Give it a ‚≠ê üîó: [LeetCode Repo](https://github.com/rishwal/leetcode)

## Problem Description

You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the `(i, j)` cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

- Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner `(0, 0)`.
- Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner `(0, cols - 1)`.

Return the maximum number of cherries collected using both robots by following the rules below:

- From a cell `(i, j)`, robots can move to cell `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, or `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- When any robot passes through a cell, it picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
- When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
- Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
- Both robots should reach the bottom row in grid.

### Example

```plaintext
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.
Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.
```

## Constraints:

- `rows == grid.length`
- `cols == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= rows, cols <= 70`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int CherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.Length;
        int cols = grid[0].Length;
        
        // Initialize dp array with -1 to denote unvisited states
        int[,,] dp = new int[rows, cols, cols];
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < cols; k++) {
                    dp[i, j, k] = -1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return MaxCherries(grid, dp, 0, 0, cols - 1);
    }
    
    private int MaxCherries(int[][] grid, int[,,] dp, int row, int col1, int col2) {
        int rows = grid.Length;
        int cols = grid[0].Length;
        
        // Base case: If we have reached the bottom row
        if (row == rows - 1) {
            return grid[row][col1] + (col1 != col2 ? grid[row][col2] : 0);
        }
        
        // If the current state has been visited before, return its value
        if (dp[row, col1, col2] != -1) {
            return dp[row, col1, col2];
        }
        
        // Calculate the cherries collected by both robots at the current state
        int cherries = grid[row][col1] + (col1 != col2 ? grid[row][col2] : 0);
        
        int maxCherries = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all possible moves for both robots
        for (int newCol1 = col1 - 1; newCol1 <= col1 + 1; newCol1++) {
            for (int newCol2 = col2 - 1; newCol2 <= col2 + 1; newCol2++) {
                // Ensure new positions are within bounds
                if (newCol1 >= 0 && newCol1 < cols && newCol2 >= 0 && newCol2 < cols) {
                    maxCherries = Math.Max(maxCherries, MaxCherries(grid, dp, row + 1, newCol1, newCol2));
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Update the dp array with the maximum cherries collected
        dp[row, col1, col2] = cherries + maxCherries;
        
        return dp[row, col1, col2];
    }
}
