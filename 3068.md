# Problem 3068: Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values

## Problem Statement
There exists an undirected tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the tree. You are also given a positive integer `k`, and a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]` represents the value of the node numbered `i`.

Alice wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum, for which Alice can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero) on the tree:

Choose any edge `[u, v]` connecting the nodes `u` and `v`, and update their values as follows:
- `nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k`
- `nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k`

Return the maximum possible sum of the values Alice can achieve by performing the operation any number of times.

### Example 1

Input: 
```
nums = [1,2,1], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
```
Output: 
```
6
```
Explanation: 
Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 6 using a single operation:
- Choose the edge `[0,2]`. `nums[0]` and `nums[2]` become: `1 XOR 3 = 2`, and the array `nums` becomes: `[1,2,1] -> [2,2,2]`.
The total sum of values is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
It can be shown that 6 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

### Example 2

Input: 
```
nums = [2,3], k = 7, edges = [[0,1]]
```
Output: 
```
9
```
Explanation: 
Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 9 using a single operation:
- Choose the edge `[0,1]`. `nums[0]` becomes: `2 XOR 7 = 5` and `nums[1]` become: `3 XOR 7 = 4`, and the array `nums` becomes: `[2,3] -> [5,4]`.
The total sum of values is `5 + 4 = 9`.
It can be shown that 9 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

### Example 3

Input: 
```
nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]]
```
Output: 
```
42
```
Explanation: 
The maximum achievable sum is 42 which can be achieved by Alice performing no operations.

### Constraints

- `2 <= n == nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`
- The input is generated such that edges represent a valid tree

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution 
{
    public long MaximumValueSum(int[] nums, int k, int[][] edges) 
    {
        long result = 0;

        // Sum the initial values of the nums array
        foreach (long num in nums)
            result += num;
        
        // Priority queue to store the differences in descending order
        var queue = new PriorityQueue<int, int>();
        
        foreach (var num in nums)
        {
            var xor = num ^ k;
            var diff = xor - num;
            
            queue.Enqueue(diff, -diff);
        }
        
        // Process the queue to maximize the sum
        while (queue.Count >= 2)
        {
            var value = queue.Dequeue() + queue.Dequeue();
            
            if (value > 0)
                result += value;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\). This is because we are using a priority queue to store and process the differences, which takes \(O(\log n)\) time for each insertion and removal operation.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because we are storing the differences for each node in the priority queue.
