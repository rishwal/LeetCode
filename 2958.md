# 2958 Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency 📏

## Question ❓
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, the frequency of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in the array. An array is called good if the frequency of each element in this array is less than or equal to `k`. Return the length of the longest good subarray of `nums`.

## Examples 📊
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [1,2,3,1,2,3] since the values 1, 2, and 3 occur at most twice in this subarray.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [1,2] since the values 1 and 2 occur at most once in this subarray.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,5,5,5,5,5,5], k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [5,5,5,5] since the value 5 occurs 4 times in this subarray.
```

## Constraints 🛑
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= k <= nums.length

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaxSubarrayLength(int[] nums, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int n = nums.Length;
        int ans = 1;
        Dictionary<int, int> map = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        while (i < n) {
            if (map.ContainsKey(nums[i]))
                map[nums[i]]++;
            else
                map[nums[i]] = 1;
            
            while (map[nums[i]] > k) {
                map[nums[j]]--;
                j++;
            }
            ans = System.Math.Max(ans, i - j + 1);
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution uses a sliding window approach. It maintains a window `[i, j]` such that the frequency of each element in the window is less than or equal to `k`. It iterates through the array `nums` using two pointers `i` and `j` to define the subarray. The variable `mp` is a dictionary that stores the frequency of each element in the current window. It updates the longest good subarray length `ans` as it moves the right pointer `j` and shrinks the window by moving the left pointer `i` when the frequency of an element exceeds `k`.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because both pointers `i` and `j` traverse the array once.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case when all elements in `nums` are unique and have distinct frequencies.
