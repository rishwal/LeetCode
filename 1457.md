# 1457 Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree

## Problem Description ‚ùì

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only the red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

### Example 2:

**Input:** `root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

### Example 3:

**Input:** `root = [9]`  
**Output:** `1`

/**

 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {

public class Solution {
    public int PseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode root) {
        return CountPseudoPalindromicPaths(root, 0);
    }

    private int CountPseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode node, int bitVector) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Update the bit vector using the current node's value
        int mask = 1 << node.val;
        bitVector ^= mask;

        // If it's a leaf node
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            // Check if the path is pseudo-palindromic
            if (bitVector == 0 || (bitVector & (bitVector - 1)) == 0) {
                return 1;
            } else {
                return 0;
            }
        }

        // Recursively count pseudo-palindromic paths in the left and right subtrees
        int leftPaths = CountPseudoPalindromicPaths(node.left, bitVector);
        int rightPaths = CountPseudoPalindromicPaths(node.right, bitVector);

        return leftPaths + rightPaths;
    }
}
```

## Explanation üìë

1. **Bit Vector and Recursion:** The algorithm uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree. At each node, it updates a bit vector based on the current node's value.

2. **Leaf Node Check:** If the current node is a leaf node, the algorithm checks whether the path is pseudo-palindromic by examining the bit vector.

3. **Pseudo-Palindromic Condition:** A path is considered pseudo-palindromic if either the bit vector is zero (indicating all values have occurred an even number of times) or the bit vector is a power of two (indicating only one value has occurred an odd number of times).

4. **Recursion:** The algorithm recursively counts the number of pseudo-palindromic paths in the left and right subtrees.

5. **Result:** The final result is the sum of pseudo-palindromic paths in the left and right subtrees.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity üïõ

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The algorithm visits each node once.

### Space Complexity üíø

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. The maximum depth of the recursive call stack is equal to the height of the tree.
