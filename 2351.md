# 2351.First Letter to Appear Twice

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

**Note:**
- A letter 'a' appears twice before another letter 'b' if the second occurrence of 'a' is before the second occurrence of 'b'.
- `s` will contain at least one letter that appears twice.

## Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abccbaacz"
Output: "c"
Explanation:
The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5, and 6.
The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3, and 7.
The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice because out of all the letters, the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abcdd"
Output: "d"
Explanation:
The only letter that appears twice is 'd' so we return 'd'.
```

## Solution

```javascript
var repeatedCharacter = function (s) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let char of s) {
        if (map.has(char)) return char;
        else map.set(char, 1);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through each character in the string once.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of distinct characters in the string `s`. In the worst case, where all characters are distinct, k would be equal to n, resulting in O(n) space complexity.
