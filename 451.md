# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
‚≠ê Check out my leetcode repo, Give it a ‚≠ê üîó: [LeetCode Repo](https://github.com/rishwal/leetcode)

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Example

```plaintext
Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string FrequencySort(string s) {
        Dictionary<char, int> frequencyMap = new Dictionary<char, int>();
        
        // Count character frequencies
        foreach (char c in s) {
            if (!frequencyMap.ContainsKey(c)) {
                frequencyMap[c] = 0;
            }
            frequencyMap[c]++;
        }
        
        // Sort characters by frequency
        List<KeyValuePair<char, int>> sortedCharacters = new List<KeyValuePair<char, int>>(frequencyMap);
        sortedCharacters.Sort((x, y) => y.Value.CompareTo(x.Value)); // Sort by frequency in descending order
        
        // Construct the result string
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (KeyValuePair<char, int> entry in sortedCharacters) {
            result.Append(new string(entry.Key, entry.Value));
        }
        
        return result.ToString();
    }
}
```
