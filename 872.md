# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

**Difficulty: Easy**

## Problem Description

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].
- Both of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public bool LeafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2)
    {      
        List<int> leafNodes1 = new List<int>();
        List<int> leafNodes2 = new List<int>(); 

        List<int> GetLeafNodes(TreeNode node,List<int> LeafNodes)
        {   
            if (node == null)
                return LeafNodes;

            GetLeafNodes(node.left, LeafNodes);

            if (node.left == null && node.right == null)
            {
                LeafNodes.Add(node.val);
            }

            GetLeafNodes(node.right, LeafNodes);

            return LeafNodes;
        }

        GetLeafNodes(root1,leafNodes1);
        GetLeafNodes(root2,leafNodes2);

        return leafNodes1.SequenceEqual(leafNodes2);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary trees.
- A helper function `GetLeafNodes` is used to obtain the leaf nodes in a depth-first manner.
- The leaf nodes for both `root1` and `root2` are obtained using this helper function.
- The solution checks if the leaf nodes for both trees are equal using `SequenceEqual` and returns the result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the binary trees.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary trees.
