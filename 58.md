# 58 Length of Last Word 📏

## Question ❓
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Examples 📝
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
```

## Constraints 🛑
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
- There will be at least one word in s.

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int length = 0;
        bool foundWord = false;
        
        for (int i = s.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] != ' ') {
                length++;
                foundWord = true;
            } else if (foundWord) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return length;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📋
This solution iterates through the string `s` from the end to the beginning. It counts the length of the last word by skipping trailing spaces and counting characters until it encounters a space character or reaches the beginning of the string.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because it iterates through the string once.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses only constant extra space, independent of the size of the input string.
