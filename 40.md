### 40 Problem Recap:
Given an array of integers `candidates` and an integer `target`, the task is to find all unique combinations of `candidates` where the numbers sum up to the target. Each number in the candidates can only be used once in each combination.

### Solution Using Backtracking:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public IList<IList<int>> CombinationSum2(int[] candidates, int target) {
        IList<IList<int>> result = new List<IList<int>>();
        Array.Sort(candidates);  // Sort the candidates to handle duplicates easily
        Backtrack(candidates, target, 0, new List<int>(), result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void Backtrack(int[] candidates, int remaining, int start, IList<int> combination, IList<IList<int>> result) {
        if (remaining == 0) {
            // If we hit the target, add a copy of the current combination to the result
            result.Add(new List<int>(combination));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.Length; i++) {
            if (i > start && candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]) {
                // Skip duplicates
                continue;
            }
            
            if (candidates[i] > remaining) {
                // No point in continuing if the candidate exceeds the remaining target
                break;
            }
            
            // Include the current candidate
            combination.Add(candidates[i]);
            // Recur with the updated remaining target
            Backtrack(candidates, remaining - candidates[i], i + 1, combination, result);
            // Backtrack: remove the last added element and try the next candidate
            combination.RemoveAt(combination.Count - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The input array `candidates` is sorted to make it easier to handle duplicates. When candidates are sorted, duplicates will be adjacent, so we can easily skip them during the recursion.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - The function `Backtrack` explores combinations by recursively including or excluding elements from the list `candidates`.
   - `remaining` keeps track of how much is left to reach the target sum.
   - If `remaining` is `0`, the current combination is a valid solution, and it is added to the results list.
   - If the candidate is greater than the `remaining` value, further exploration is unnecessary, so the loop breaks.

3. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - By checking `if (i > start && candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1])`, we ensure that we skip processing duplicate numbers in the same position, thus avoiding duplicate combinations.

4. **Complexity Considerations**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(2^n) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of `candidates`. This is because, in the worst case, we might explore all possible combinations.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(k * x), where `k` is the average length of a combination and `x` is the total number of valid combinations.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5]` and `target = 8`:
- The sorted array is `[1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10]`.
- The backtracking approach will start with the smallest number, explore all possibilities, skip duplicates, and ensure each valid combination sums up to `8`.

### Summary:
This backtracking solution efficiently handles the problem of finding unique combinations that sum to a given target by exploring each possibility while skipping over duplicates and backtracking whenever necessary.
