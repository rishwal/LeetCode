# Count Elements With Maximum Frequency üî¢

## Question ‚ùì
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers. Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

## Examples üåü
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
```

## Solution üí°

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaxFrequencyElements(int[] nums) {
        Dictionary<int, int> frequencyMap = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        // Count frequencies of elements
        foreach (int num in nums) {
            if (frequencyMap.ContainsKey(num))
                frequencyMap[num]++;
            else
                frequencyMap[num] = 1;
        }

        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int countOfMaxFrequency = 0;

        // Find the maximum frequency
        foreach (var pair in frequencyMap) {
            if (pair.Value > maxFrequency) {
                maxFrequency = pair.Value;
                countOfMaxFrequency = 1; // Reset count since we found a new maximum
            }
            else if (pair.Value == maxFrequency) {
                countOfMaxFrequency++; // Increment count if frequency matches the max
            }
        }

        return countOfMaxFrequency * maxFrequency;
    }
}
```

## Explanation üìù
This solution utilizes a dictionary to count the frequencies of each element in the array. Then, it iterates through the dictionary to find the maximum frequency. Finally, it calculates the total frequencies of elements with the maximum frequency by multiplying the count of elements with the maximum frequency by the maximum frequency itself.

## Time Complexity ‚è∞
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate through the array once to count the frequencies and then iterate through the dictionary to find the maximum frequency.

## Space Complexity üöÄ
The space complexity is also O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because we use a dictionary to store the frequency counts of each element.
