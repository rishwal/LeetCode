# 1669 Merge In Between Linked Lists 🔄

## Question ❓
You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.

Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.

Build the result list and return its head.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
```

## Constraints ✋
- 3 <= list1.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1
- 1 <= list2.length <= 10^4

## Solution 💡

```csharp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public ListNode next;
 *     public ListNode(int val=0, ListNode next=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.next = next;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode MergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode prevNode = list1;
        for (int i = 1; i < a; i++) {
            prevNode = prevNode.next;
        }
        
        ListNode nextNode = prevNode;
        for (int i = a; i <= b + 1; i++) {
            nextNode = nextNode.next;
        }
        
        prevNode.next = list2;
        
        ListNode endOfList2 = list2;
        while (endOfList2.next != null) {
            endOfList2 = endOfList2.next;
        }
        
        endOfList2.next = nextNode;
        
        return list1;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution traverses through list1 to find the node before the start position `a` and the node after the end position `b`. It then connects the `prevNode` to list2, and the end of list2 to `nextNode`, effectively merging list2 between the ath and bth nodes of list1.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in list1.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(1) since the additional space used is constant, regardless of the input size.
