# 930 Binary Subarrays With Sum 🔢

## Question ❓
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to `goal`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15
```

## Constraints ✋
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
- 0 <= goal <= nums.length

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int count = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        Dictionary<int, int> frequency = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        foreach (int num in nums)
        {
            sum += num;
            if (sum == goal)
                count++;

            if (frequency.ContainsKey(sum - goal))
                count += frequency[sum - goal];

            if (!frequency.ContainsKey(sum))
                frequency[sum] = 1;
            else
                frequency[sum]++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution iterates through the binary array `nums` and maintains a running sum. It keeps track of the frequency of each sum encountered so far using a dictionary. For each element in `nums`, it checks if the current sum minus the `goal` sum exists in the dictionary. If it does, it adds the frequency of that sum to the total count. Finally, it updates the frequency of the current sum in the dictionary.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is also O(n), as the algorithm uses a dictionary to store the frequency of sums.
