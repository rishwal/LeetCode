# 232 Implement Queue using Stacks

## Problem Description

Implement a first in, first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

- `void push(int x)`: Pushes element `x` to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()`: Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()`: Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()`: Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

### Notes:

- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only `push` to top, `peek`/`pop` from top, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

## Example

### Example:

```plaintext
Input:
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]

Output:
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation:
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= x <= 9
- At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
- All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

### Follow-up:

Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

```csharp
public class MyQueue {
    Stack<int> stack;
    Stack<int> queue;

    public MyQueue()
    {
        stack = new Stack<int>();
        queue = new Stack<int>();
    }

    public void Push(int x)
    {
        stack.Push(x);
    }

    public int Pop()
    {
        if (queue.Count == 0)
        {
            while (stack.Count > 0)
                queue.Push(stack.Pop());
        }

        return queue.Pop();
    }

    public int Peek()
    {
        if (queue.Count == 0)
        {
            while (stack.Count > 0)
                queue.Push(stack.Pop());
        }

        return queue.Peek();
    }

    public bool Empty()
    { 
        return (queue.Count == 0 && stack.Count == 0);
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj.Push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.Pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.Peek();
 * bool param_4 = obj.Empty();
 */
```

## Explanation

1. **Two Stacks:** The algorithm uses two stacks, `stack` and `queue`, to simulate a queue.

2. **Push Operation:** The `push` operation is straightforward; it pushes the element `x` to the `stack`.

3. **Pop and Peek Operations:** The `pop` and `peek` operations involve transferring elements from `stack` to `queue`. If the `queue` is empty, the algorithm transfers all elements from `stack` to `queue`. The element is then popped or peeked from the `queue`.

4. **Empty Operation:** The `empty` operation checks whether both `queue` and `stack` are empty.

5. **Amortized O(1) Time Complexity:** The algorithm ensures that the amortized time complexity of each operation is O(1) by transferring elements from `stack` to `queue` only when necessary. This is done when the `queue` is empty. Each element is transferred only once, making the overall amortized time complexity O(1).
