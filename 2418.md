# LeetCode Question 2418 - Sort the People

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 
```javascript
names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], 
heights = [180,165,170]
```

Output: 
```javascript
["Mary","Emma","John"]
```

Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

### Example 2:

Input: 
```javascript
names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], 
heights = [155,185,150]
```

Output: 
```javascript
["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
```

Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

## Solution

```javascript
var sortPeople = function (names, heights) {
    const heightArray = [...heights];
    const newArr = heights.slice().sort((a, b) => b - a);
    let res = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
        res[i] = names[heightArray.indexOf(newArr[i])];
    }

    return res;
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Copy the Heights Array:**
   - `const heightArray = [...heights];`: Create a copy of the `heights` array using the spread operator (`...`). This is done to avoid modifying the original array when sorting.

2. **Sort Heights in Descending Order:**
   - `const newArr = heights.slice().sort((a, b) => b - a);`: Create a new array `newArr` that contains the heights sorted in descending order using the `sort()` method with a custom comparison function.

3. **Map Sorted Heights to Names:**
   - `for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) { res[i] = names[heightArray.indexOf(newArr[i])]; }`: Iterate over the names array and map each name to its corresponding position in the original `names` array using the sorted heights.

4. **Return Result:**
   - `return res;`: Return the array of names sorted in descending order based on the corresponding heights.

### Example:

Let's take the first example from the problem:

```javascript
names = ["Mary","John","Emma"]
heights = [180,165,170]
```

- After sorting the heights in descending order, `newArr` becomes `[180, 170, 165]`.
- The result array `res` is filled based on the index of each height in the original `heights` array. So, the final result is `["Mary","Emma","John"]`.

### Time Complexity:

- The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting operation, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input arrays.

### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays. This is due to the additional space used to store the sorted array and other auxiliary arrays.
