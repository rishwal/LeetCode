# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

## Question

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Examples

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[] SortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.Length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int left = 0, right = n - 1, index = n - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int leftSquare = nums[left] * nums[left];
            int rightSquare = nums[right] * nums[right];
            
            if (leftSquare > rightSquare) {
                result[index--] = leftSquare;
                left++;
            } else {
                result[index--] = rightSquare;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

This solution utilizes two pointers starting from the ends of the array. We compare the squares of the elements pointed to by the left and right pointers. Since the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the largest squares will be either at the beginning or at the end of the resulting array. We store the larger square at the end of the `result` array and decrement the index accordingly. Finally, we return the `result` array, which contains squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we only need to traverse the array once with two pointers.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we use an additional array `result` to store the squared values.
