# Problem 2486: Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

## Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

### Examples

#### Example 1
- **Input:** `s = "coaching"`, `t = "coding"`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:**
  - Append the characters "ding" to the end of `s` so that `s = "coachingding"`.
  - Now, `t` is a subsequence of `s` ("coachingding").
  - It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of `s` will never make `t` a subsequence.

#### Example 2
- **Input:** `s = "abcde"`, `t = "a"`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:**
  - `t` is already a subsequence of `s` ("abcde").

#### Example 3
- **Input:** `s = "z"`, `t = "abcde"`
- **Output:** `5`
- **Explanation:**
  - Append the characters "abcde" to the end of `s` so that `s = "zabcde".
  - Now, `t` is a subsequence of `s` ("zabcde").
  - It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of `s` will never make `t` a subsequence.

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach to find the longest prefix of `t` that is a subsequence of `s`. The steps are as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse strings `s` and `t`, respectively.
2. Move through both strings using the pointers:
   - If `s[i] == t[j]`, it means we have matched one character of `t` in `s`. Move both pointers to the next characters.
   - If `s[i] != t[j]`, move the pointer `i` to the next character in `s` without moving `j`.
3. When we finish the traversal, the pointer `j` will point to the first unmatched character in `t`.
4. The number of characters to append is `len(t) - j`.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int AppendCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int m = s.Length, n = t.Length;
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        // Traverse through both strings with two pointers
        while (i < m && j < n) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                j++;  // Move t's pointer when characters match
            }
            i++;  // Always move s's pointer
        }

        // Return the number of characters to append
        return n - j;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`. We traverse both strings once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space.
```
