# 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums

**Approach: Monotonically Increasing Stack**

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `arr`, find the sum of min(b), where b ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of `arr`. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Example

### Example 1:

Input: `arr = [3,1,2,4]`  
Output: `17`  
Explanation:  
Subarrays are [3], [1], [2], [4], [3,1], [1,2], [2,4], [3,1,2], [1,2,4], [3,1,2,4].  
Minimums are 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1.  
Sum is 17.

### Example 2:

Input: `arr = [11,81,94,43,3]`  
Output: `444`

## Solution in C#:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int SumSubarrayMins(int[] arr) {
        const int Modulo = 1000000007;
        Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();
        long sumOfMinimums = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i <= arr.Length; i++) {
            while (stack.Count > 0 && (i == arr.Length || arr[stack.Peek()] >= arr[i])) {
                int mid = stack.Pop();
                int leftBoundary = stack.Count == 0 ? -1 : stack.Peek();
                int rightBoundary = i;

                long subarrayCount  = ((mid - leftBoundary) * (rightBoundary - mid)) % Modulo;

                sumOfMinimums += (subarrayCount  * arr[mid]) % Modulo;
                sumOfMinimums %= Modulo;
            }
            stack.Push(i);
        }

        return (int)sumOfMinimums;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Monotonically Increasing Stack:

The algorithm uses a monotonically increasing stack to keep track of the indices of elements in the array.

### Iterating Through Array:

It iterates through the array and processes each element.

### Processing Elements:

For each element, the algorithm checks if the stack is not empty and the current element is less than the element at the top of the stack. If true, it means the current element is a potential minimum for elements in the stack.

### Calculating Subarray Counts:

For each element popped from the stack, the algorithm calculates the count of subarrays where that element is the minimum. The count is calculated by multiplying the difference between the left and right boundaries by the difference between the right boundary and the popped element.

### Calculating Contribution:

The algorithm calculates the contribution of the current minimum to the sum of minimums. It multiplies the count by the value of the minimum and updates the sum of minimums.

### Modulo Operation:

To prevent integer overflow, the algorithm performs the modulo operation (MOD) on intermediate and final results.

### Final Result:

The final result is the sum of minimums of all subarrays.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the input array `arr`. The algorithm iterates through the array once.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input array `arr`. The main space usage comes from the monotonically increasing stack. Additionally, the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `sumOfMinimums`, `stack`, and loop indices.
