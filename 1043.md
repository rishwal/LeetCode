# 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum 🚀

## Question  ❓
Given an integer array arr, partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most k. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.  
Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning. Test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

## Example 
**Example 1:**
Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3  
Output: 84  
Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]

**Example 2:**
Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4  
Output: 83

**Example 3:**
Input: arr = [1], k = 1  
Output: 1

## Constraints
1 <= arr.length <= 500  
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9  
1 <= k <= arr.length

## Solution 🧠 In C#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaxSumAfterPartitioning(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.Length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int maxInCurrentWindow = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= k && i - j >= 0; j++) {
                maxInCurrentWindow = Math.Max(maxInCurrentWindow, arr[i - j]);
                dp[i] = Math.Max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + maxInCurrentWindow * j);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📑

Sure, let's break down the solution for a better understanding:

**Problem:**
Given an integer array `arr`, partition the array into contiguous subarrays of length at most `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has its values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray. Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

**Example:**
Input: `arr = [1, 15, 7, 9, 2, 5, 10]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `84`  
Explanation: `arr` becomes `[15, 15, 15, 9, 10, 10, 10]`

**Approach:**
- Initialize an array `dp` of length `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`. This array will be used to store the maximum sum at each index.
- Iterate over the array from index `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, iterate over the last `k` indices (or less if `i - j` is less than `0`).
- Find the maximum value in the current window (`maxInCurrentWindow`).
- Update `dp[i]` using the formula: `dp[i] = Math.Max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + maxInCurrentWindow * j)`. This ensures that we maximize the sum by considering the current window and the maximum value in that window.
- The final answer is stored in `dp[n]`, where `n` is the length of the array.

**Time Complexity:** ⌛
- The time complexity is O(n * k), where `n` is the length of the input array and `k` is the partition size.

**Space Complexity:** 💿
- The space complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.

This dynamic programming approach efficiently computes the maximum sum after partitioning the array.
