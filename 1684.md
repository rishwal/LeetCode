# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array `words`.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: 
  ```plaintext
  allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```plaintext
  2
  ```
- **Explanation**: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

### Example 2:
- **Input**: 
  ```plaintext
  allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```plaintext
  7
  ```
- **Explanation**: All strings are consistent.

### Example 3:
- **Input**: 
  ```plaintext
  allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```plaintext
  4
  ```
- **Explanation**: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= allowed.length <= 26
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
- The characters in `allowed` are distinct.
- `words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int CountConsistentStrings(string allowed, string[] words) {
        int allowedChars = 0;
        foreach (char ch in allowed.ToCharArray()) {
            allowedChars |= 1 << (ch - 'a'); // Set bit for each allowed character
        }

        int count = 0;
        foreach (string word in words) {
            int wordChars = 0;
            foreach (char ch in word.ToCharArray()) {
                wordChars |= 1 << (ch - 'a'); // Create a bitmask for the word
            }

            if ((wordChars & allowedChars) == wordChars) {  // Check if all bits in word are also in allowed
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Bitmask for Allowed Characters**: 
   - A bitmask is created where each bit corresponds to a character in `allowed`. For example, if `allowed = "abc"`, the bitmask would have bits set for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
   
2. **Bitmask for Each Word**: 
   - For each word, a bitmask is created similar to `allowed`. The bitmask reflects which characters are present in the word.

3. **Comparison**:
   - If all bits set in the word's bitmask are also set in the `allowed` bitmask, the word is considered consistent.

4. **Count of Consistent Strings**:
   - The program counts how many words meet the condition of being consistent and returns the count.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n * k)**, where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of the words. The space complexity is **O(1)** since we're only using a fixed-size bitmask.
