# 3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `word` containing lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c".

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type `word` after remapping the keys.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.

### Example 1

**Input**: `word = "abcde"`

**Output**: `5`

**Explanation**: 
- "a" -> one push on key 2
- "b" -> one push on key 3
- "c" -> one push on key 4
- "d" -> one push on key 5
- "e" -> one push on key 6

Total cost is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.

### Example 2

**Input**: `word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"`

**Output**: `12`

**Explanation**: 
- "x" -> one push on key 2
- "y" -> one push on key 3
- "z" -> one push on key 4

Total cost is `1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12`.

### Example 3

**Input**: `word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"`

**Output**: `24`

**Explanation**: 
- "a" -> one push on key 2
- "b" -> one push on key 3
- "c" -> one push on key 4
- "d" -> one push on key 5
- "e" -> one push on key 6
- "f" -> one push on key 7
- "g" -> one push on key 8
- "h" -> two pushes on key 9
- "i" -> one push on key 9

Total cost is `1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 24`.

### Constraints

- `1 <= word.length <= 105`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
1. Count the frequency of each character in the given word.
2. Sort the frequencies in descending order.
3. Allocate the most frequent characters to the keys with the least number of pushes.
4. Accumulate the total number of pushes required.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinimumPushes(string word) {
        Dictionary<char, int> freq = new Dictionary<char, int>();
        
        foreach (char ch in word) {
            if (!freq.ContainsKey(ch)) {
                freq[ch] = 0;
            }
            freq[ch]++;
        }

        var sortedFreq = freq.Values.OrderByDescending(f => f).ToArray();
        int totalPresses = 0;
        int keyPressCount = 1;
        int keysUsed = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < sortedFreq.Length; i++) {
            totalPresses += sortedFreq[i] * keyPressCount;
            keysUsed++;
            if (keysUsed == 8) {
                keyPressCount++;
                keysUsed = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return totalPresses;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Examples

#### Example 1

For `word = "abcde"`:
- The most efficient mapping results in each letter being mapped to a different key, each requiring only one push.
- Hence, the function returns `5`.

#### Example 2

For `word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"`:
- The letters `x`, `y`, and `z` are each mapped to a different key, each requiring only one push.
- Hence, the function returns `12`.

#### Example 3

For `word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"`:
- The letters are mapped in such a way that the total number of pushes is minimized.
- Hence, the function returns `24`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of distinct characters in the word, due to sorting the frequencies.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of distinct characters in the word.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of pushes needed to type the word is calculated efficiently.
