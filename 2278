# LeetCode Problem 2278: Percentage of Letter in String

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` and a character `letter`, return the percentage of characters in `s` that equal `letter` rounded down to the nearest whole percent.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** 
```
s = "foobar", letter = "o"
```

**Output:**
```
33
```

**Explanation:**
The percentage of characters in `s` that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33.

### Example 2:

**Input:** 
```
s = "jjjj", letter = "k"
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
The percentage of characters in `s` that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.

## My Solution

```javascript
var percentageLetter = function (s, letter) {
    let count = 0;
    count = s.split('').reduce((prev, alphabet) => {
        if (alphabet === letter) {
            return prev + 1;
        } else {
            return prev;
        }
    }, 0);

    return Math.round((count / s.length) * 100);
};

console.log(percentageLetter("foobar", 'o'));
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - where n is the length of the input string `s`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - constant space used.

```
