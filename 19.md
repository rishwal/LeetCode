# 19 Remove Nth Node From End of List 📃

## Question ❓
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head. 🚀

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

## Solution

```csharp
public class ListNode {
    public int val;
    public ListNode next;
    public ListNode(int val=0, ListNode next=null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode RemoveNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode first = dummy;
        ListNode second = dummy;

        // Move first pointer to the (n + 1)th node from the beginning
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            first = first.next;
        }

        // Move both pointers until the first pointer reaches the end
        while (first != null) {
            first = first.next;
            second = second.next;
        }

        // Remove the nth node from the end by adjusting the pointers
        second.next = second.next.next;

        return dummy.next; // Return the updated head of the list
    }
}
```

## Explanation
This solution maintains two pointers, `first` and `second`, initially pointing to the dummy node. First, the `first` pointer is moved `n + 1` steps ahead. Then, both pointers are moved simultaneously until the `first` pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the `second` pointer is at the `(n - 1)`th node from the end. Finally, the `next` pointer of the `(n - 1)`th node is adjusted to skip the nth node, effectively removing it from the list. The function returns the head of the modified list. This algorithm traverses the list only once, hence achieving the one-pass requirement. 🧠

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the entire list once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. 📊
