# 2540 Minimum Common Value 🔢

## Question ❓
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return -1.

Note that an integer is said to be common to `nums1` and `nums2` if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.
```

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int GetCommon(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < nums1.Length && j < nums2.Length) {
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[j]) {
                return nums1[i];
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution iterates through both arrays simultaneously using two pointers `i` and `j`. At each step, it compares the values at the current indices of `nums1` and `nums2`. If the values are equal, it returns that value as it is the minimum common value. If the value in `nums1` is greater, it increments the pointer `j`. If the value in `nums2` is greater, it increments the pointer `i`. This process continues until either the end of one of the arrays is reached or a common value is found.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N + M), where N is the length of `nums1` and M is the length of `nums2`. This is because we iterate through both arrays simultaneously until we find a common value or reach the end of either array.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables `i` and `j`.
