# Problem 1642: Furthest Building You Can Reach

## Problem Description
You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed):
- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

### Example 1:
**Input**: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1  
**Output**: 4  
**Explanation**:  
Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.

### Example 2:
**Input**: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2  
**Output**: 7

### Example 3:
**Input**: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0  
**Output**: 3

## Solution:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FurthestBuilding(int[] heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        var minHeap = new MinHeap();

        for (int i = 0; i < heights.Length - 1; i++) {
            int diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i];
            if (diff > 0) {
                if (ladders > 0) {
                    minHeap.Enqueue(diff);
                    ladders--;
                } else if (minHeap.Count > 0 && diff > minHeap.Peek()) {
                    bricks -= minHeap.Dequeue();
                    minHeap.Enqueue(diff);
                } else {
                    bricks -= diff;
                }
                if (bricks < 0) return i;
            }
        }
        return heights.Length - 1;
    }
}

public class MinHeap {
    private List<int> heap;

    public MinHeap() {
        heap = new List<int>();
    }

    public int Count => heap.Count;

    public void Enqueue(int item) {
        heap.Add(item);
        int i = heap.Count - 1;
        while (i > 0 && heap[(i - 1) / 2] > heap[i]) {
            (heap[i], heap[(i - 1) / 2]) = (heap[(i - 1) / 2], heap[i]);
            i = (i - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

    public int Dequeue() {
        if (heap.Count == 0) throw new InvalidOperationException("Queue empty");
        int item = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap[heap.Count - 1];
        heap.RemoveAt(heap.Count - 1);
        int i = 0;
        while (i < heap.Count) {
            int leftChild = 2 * i + 1;
            int rightChild = 2 * i + 2;
            int minIndex = i;
            if (leftChild < heap.Count && heap[leftChild] < heap[minIndex]) minIndex = leftChild;
            if (rightChild < heap.Count && heap[rightChild] < heap[minIndex]) minIndex = rightChild;
            if (minIndex == i) break;
            (heap[i], heap[minIndex]) = (heap[minIndex], heap[i]);
            i = minIndex;
        }
        return item;
    }

    public int Peek() {
        if (heap.Count == 0) throw new InvalidOperationException("Queue empty");
        return heap[0];
    }
}
```

## Explanation:
- We use a min-heap to keep track of the height differences between consecutive buildings.
- While iterating through the heights array, for each pair of adjacent buildings, we calculate the height difference.
- If the height difference is positive, it

 means we need either bricks or a ladder to move to the next building.
- We use ladders if available, otherwise, we use bricks, updating the heap as needed.
- We keep track of remaining bricks. If the remaining bricks become negative, it means we cannot proceed further, and we return the index of the last visited building.
- If we successfully iterate through all the buildings, it means we can reach the last building, and we return its index.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of heap operations like insertion and deletion is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.
- Since we iterate through the entire heights array once and perform heap operations for each height difference, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

## Space Complexity:
- We use extra space to store the min-heap, which can have a maximum size of n - 1 (where n is the length of the heights array).
- Hence, the space complexity is O(n).
