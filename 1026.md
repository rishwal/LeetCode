# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

**Difficulty: Medium**

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist different nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either: any child of `a` is equal to `b` or any child of `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below:
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 10^5

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {

    private int DFS(TreeNode node, int minAncestor, int maxAncestor)
    {
        if (node == null)
            return maxAncestor - minAncestor;

        minAncestor = Math.Min(minAncestor, node.val);
        maxAncestor = Math.Max(maxAncestor, node.val);

        int leftDiff = DFS(node.left, minAncestor, maxAncestor);
        int rightDiff = DFS(node.right, minAncestor, maxAncestor);

        return Math.Max(leftDiff, rightDiff);
    }

    public int MaxAncestorDiff(TreeNode root) {
        return DFS(root, root.val, root.val);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution uses a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree.
- The function `DFS` calculates the maximum difference between an ancestor node and its descendants.
- The `minAncestor` and `maxAncestor` parameters are used to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered during traversal.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.
