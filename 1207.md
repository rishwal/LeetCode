# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2, and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `arr = [1,2]`  
**Output:** `false`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]`  
**Output:** `true`

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
- -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public bool UniqueOccurrences(int[] arr)
    {
        Dictionary<int, int> Occurrences = new();
        foreach (int num in arr)
        {
            if (Occurrences.ContainsKey(num))
            {
                Occurrences[num]++;
            }
            else
            {
                Occurrences.Add(num, 1);
            }
        }
        HashSet<int> UniqueValueCount = new HashSet<int>(Occurrences.Values);

        return Occurrences.Values.SequenceEqual(UniqueValueCount);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Create a `Dictionary<int, int>` called `Occurrences` to count the occurrences of each number in the array.
2. **Count Occurrences:** Iterate through the array and update the count of occurrences in the `Occurrences` dictionary.
3. **Check Uniqueness:** Create a `HashSet<int>` called `UniqueValueCount` to store unique counts. Check if the counts in the `Occurrences` dictionary are equal to the unique counts.
4. **Result:** Return the result of the uniqueness check.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we iterate through the array once.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the input array, due to the space used by the `Occurrences` dictionary and the `UniqueValueCount` HashSet.
