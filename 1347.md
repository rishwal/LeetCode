# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

**Difficulty: Medium**

## Problem Description

You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step, you can choose any character of `t` and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with 'b', t = "bba" which is an anagram of s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i', and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t an anagram of s.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s.length == t.length
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinSteps(string s, string t) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int i = 0;

        while (i < s.Length) {
            count[t[i] - 'a']++;
            count[s[i] - 'a']--;
            i++;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        i = 0;

        while (i < 26) {
            ans += Math.Max(0, count[i]);
            i++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution uses an array `count` of size 26 to keep track of the frequency difference between characters in strings `s` and `t`.
- Iterates through the characters of both strings, updating the count array accordingly.
- Counts the number of steps needed to make `t` an anagram of `s` by summing the positive values in the count array.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of strings `s` or `t`.
