# 273. Integer to English Words

## Problem Statement

Convert a non-negative integer `num` to its English words representation.

### Example 1

**Input**: num = 123

**Output**: "One Hundred Twenty Three"

### Example 2

**Input**: num = 12345

**Output**: "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"

### Example 3

**Input**: num = 1234567

**Output**: "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"

### Constraints

- 0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1

## Solution

The solution involves breaking the number into groups of thousands and converting each group to words. We use arrays to store words for numbers below twenty, tens, and thousands. The helper function converts numbers below 1000 to words.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    private string[] belowTwenty = {"", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", 
                                    "Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen", "Fourteen", "Fifteen", "Sixteen", 
                                    "Seventeen", "Eighteen", "Nineteen"};
    
    private string[] tens = {"", "", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"};
    
    private string[] thousands = {"", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"};
    
    public string NumberToWords(int num) {
        if (num == 0)
            return "Zero";
        
        int i = 0;
        string words = "";
        
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 1000 != 0) {
                words = Helper(num % 1000) + thousands[i] + " " + words;
            }
            num /= 1000;
            i++;
        }
        
        return words.Trim();
    }

    private string Helper(int num) {
        if (num == 0)
            return "";
        else if (num < 20)
            return belowTwenty[num] + " ";
        else if (num < 100)
            return tens[num / 10] + " " + Helper(num % 10);
        else
            return belowTwenty[num / 100] + " Hundred " + Helper(num % 100);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Below Twenty Array**: Contains words for numbers from 0 to 19.
- **Tens Array**: Contains words for tens multiples from 20 to 90.
- **Thousands Array**: Contains words for thousands, millions, and billions.

### Examples

#### Example 1

For `num = 123`:
- The function processes "123" as "One Hundred Twenty Three".
- Hence, the function returns `"One Hundred Twenty Three"`.

#### Example 2

For `num = 12345`:
- The function processes "12" and "345" separately as "Twelve Thousand" and "Three Hundred Forty Five".
- Hence, the function returns `"Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"`.

#### Example 3

For `num = 1234567`:
- The function processes "1", "234", and "567" separately as "One Million", "Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand", and "Five Hundred Sixty Seven".
- Hence, the function returns `"One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of digits in `num`. The solution processes each group of three digits in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used is independent of the input size.

This approach efficiently converts any non-negative integer within the given constraints to its English words representation.
