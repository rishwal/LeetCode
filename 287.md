# 287 Find the Duplicate Number 🔄

## Question ❓
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.


You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and use only constant extra space.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints ✋
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- nums.length == n + 1
- 1 <= nums[i] <= n
- All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

## Follow up ✨
- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int tortoise = nums[0];
        int hare = nums[0];

        do {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[nums[hare]];
        } while (tortoise != hare);

        // Find the entrance to the cycle
        tortoise = nums[0];
        while (tortoise != hare) {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[hare];
        }

        return hare;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as the cycle detection algorithm. It iterates through the array using two pointers, tortoise and hare. The tortoise moves one step at a time while the hare moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the array, the tortoise and hare will meet at some point. After they meet, the tortoise is moved back to the start of the array, and both pointers move one step at a time. The point at which they meet again is the duplicate number.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(1) since the additional space used is constant, regardless of the input size.
