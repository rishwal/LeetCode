# 1219. Path with Maximum Gold

Difficulty: Medium

## Description

In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.

## Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24

Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold: 9 -> 8 -> 7.

## Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28

Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.

## Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 15
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
- There are at most 25 cells containing gold.

## Solution:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int GetMaximumGold(int[][] grid) {
        int maxGold = 0;
        int rows = grid.Length;
        int cols = grid[0].Length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != 0) {
                    maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, FindMaxGold(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxGold;
    }
    
    private int FindMaxGold(int[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        if (row < 0 || row >= grid.Length || col < 0 || col >= grid[0].Length || grid[row][col] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int currentGold = grid[row][col];
        grid[row][col] = 0; // Mark as visited
        
        int maxGold = 0;
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + FindMaxGold(grid, row + 1, col)); // Down
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + FindMaxGold(grid, row - 1, col)); // Up
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + FindMaxGold(grid, row, col + 1)); // Right
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + FindMaxGold(grid, row, col - 1)); // Left
        
        grid[row][col] = currentGold; // Backtrack
        
        return maxGold;
    }
}
