# LeetCode Solution: Count Items Matching a Rule

## Problem Description

You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

- `ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == typei`.
- `ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == colori`.
- `ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == namei`.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.

### Example 1

Input:
```javascript
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]],
ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
```
Output:
```javascript
1
```
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

### Example 2

Input:
```javascript
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]],
ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
```
Output:
```javascript
2
```
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.

## Solution

```javascript
var countMatches = function (items, ruleKey, ruleValue) {
    let count = 0;
    switch (ruleKey) {
        case "type": items.forEach(item => { item[0] === ruleValue && count++ })
            break;
        case "color": items.forEach(item => { item[1] === ruleValue && count++ })
            break;
        case "name": items.forEach(item => { item[2] === ruleValue && count++ })
            break;
        default: count = 0;
            break;
    }
    return count;
};

console.log(countMatches(items, ruleKey, ruleValue));
```

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of items in the array. This is because the solution iterates through each item once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as the solution uses only a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
