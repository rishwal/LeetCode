# Problem: Count Elements with Strictly Smaller and Greater Neighbors

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in `nums`.

## Example

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [11,7,2,15]`

Output: `2`

Explanation: 
- The element `7` has the element `2` strictly smaller than it and the element `11` strictly greater than it.
- Element `11` has element `7` strictly smaller than it and element `15` strictly greater than it.
In total there are `2` elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in `nums`.

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [-3,3,3,90]`

Output: `2`

Explanation: 
- The element `3` has the element `-3` strictly smaller than it and the element `90` strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value `3`, in total there are `2` elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in `nums.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the number of elements in the array that have both a strictly smaller
 * and a strictly greater element in the array.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array of integers.
 * @returns {number} - The count of elements with both smaller and greater neighbors.
 */
var countElements = function(nums) {
    let min = Math.min(...nums);
    let max = Math.max(...nums);
    let count = 0;

    nums.forEach((item, index) => {
        if (item > min && item < max) {
            count++;
        }
    });

    return count;
};
```
