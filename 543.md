# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
## Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Example
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution
```csharp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    int max=0;
    public int DiameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        this.Helper(root);
        return max;
    }

    public int Helper(TreeNode root)
    {
        if(root==null) return 0;
        int left = this.Helper(root.left);
        int right = this.Helper(root.right);
        max=Math.Max(max,left+right);
        return Math.Max(left,right)+1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree.
