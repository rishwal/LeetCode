# Problem 648: Replace Words

## Problem Statement
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

### Examples

#### Example 1
- **Input:** `dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"]`, `sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"`
- **Output:** `"the cat was rat by the bat"`

#### Example 2
- **Input:** `dictionary = ["a","b","c"]`, `sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"`
- **Output:** `"a a b c"`

### Constraints
- `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100`
- `dictionary[i]` consists of only lower-case letters.
- `1 <= sentence.length <= 10^6`
- `sentence` consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
- The number of words in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- The length of each word in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- Every two consecutive words in `sentence` will be separated by exactly one space.
- `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.

## Solution

### Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a Trie (prefix tree) to store the dictionary roots. This allows us to efficiently find the shortest root for each word in the sentence. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Build the Trie:** Insert all roots from the dictionary into a Trie.
2. **Process each word in the sentence:** For each word, traverse the Trie to find the shortest root that matches the prefix of the word.
3. **Replace words:** Replace the word with the found root or keep it as is if no root is found.
4. **Reconstruct the sentence:** Join the processed words back into a single sentence.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public class TrieNode {
        public Dictionary<char, TrieNode> Children = new Dictionary<char, TrieNode>();
        public string Word;
    }

    public string ReplaceWords(IList<string> dictionary, string sentence) {
        TrieNode root = BuildTrie(dictionary);

        string[] words = sentence.Split(' ');
        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++) {
            words[i] = FindRoot(root, words[i]);
        }

        return string.Join(" ", words);
    }

    private TrieNode BuildTrie(IList<string> dictionary) {
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
        foreach (var word in dictionary) {
            TrieNode node = root;
            foreach (var ch in word) {
                if (!node.Children.ContainsKey(ch)) {
                    node.Children[ch] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node.Children[ch];
            }
            node.Word = word;
        }
        return root;
    }

    private string FindRoot(TrieNode root, string word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        foreach (var ch in word) {
            if (node.Children.ContainsKey(ch)) {
                node = node.Children[ch];
                if (node.Word != null) {
                    return node.Word;
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return word;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Trie Construction:** We build the Trie by iterating through each word in the dictionary and inserting it character by character.
- **Word Replacement:** For each word in the sentence, we traverse the Trie to find the shortest root. If a root is found, it replaces the word; otherwise, the original word remains.
- **Efficiency:** The Trie ensures that we efficiently find the shortest root for each word in the sentence, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(N * L + M), where N is the number of words in the dictionary, L is the average length of the words in the dictionary, and M is the length of the sentence.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * L + M), where N is the number of words in the dictionary, L is the average length of the words in the dictionary, and M is the length of the sentence.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * L), for storing the Trie.
