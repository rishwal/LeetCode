# 1550. Three Consecutive Odds

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1

**Input**: `arr = [2,6,4,1]`

**Output**: `false`

**Explanation**: There are no three consecutive odds.

### Example 2

**Input**: `arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]`

**Output**: `true`

**Explanation**: `[5,7,23]` are three consecutive odds.

### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to keep track of three consecutive numbers and check if they are all odd.

### Steps

1. Initialize a variable `window` to keep track of the number of odd numbers in the current window of size 3.
2. Iterate through the first three elements of the array and update the `window`.
3. If the `window` equals 3, return `true`.
4. Iterate through the rest of the array, updating the `window` by adding the current element's parity and subtracting the parity of the element that is leaving the window.
5. If the `window` equals 3 at any point, return `true`.
6. If the loop completes without finding three consecutive odd numbers, return `false`.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool ThreeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int window = 0;

        // Check the first three elements
        for(int i = 0; i < 3 && i < arr.Length; i++) {
            window += arr[i] % 2;
        }
        if(window == 3) {
            return true;
        }

        // Sliding window
        for(int i = 3; i < arr.Length; i++) {
            window += arr[i] % 2;
            window -= arr[i - 3] % 2;
            if(window == 3) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Examples

#### Example 1

For `arr = [2,6,4,1]`:
- The array does not have three consecutive odd numbers.
- Hence, the function returns `false`.

#### Example 2

For `arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]`:
- The array has three consecutive odd numbers `[5,7,23]`.
- Hence, the function returns `true`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures an efficient check for three consecutive odd numbers in the array.
