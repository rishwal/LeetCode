# 1514 Path with max probability
The problem is to find the path with the maximum probability from a given start node to an end node in an undirected weighted graph, where the weights are probabilities. Here's a correct approach using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is more efficient than the Bellman-Ford approach (used in the provided code) for this particular problem.

### Solution Explanation:
- **Graph Representation**: First, we can represent the graph as an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors along with the edge probability.
- **Priority Queue**: We'll use a max-heap (priority queue) to always explore the node with the current maximum probability.
- **Relaxation**: For each node, we update the probability of reaching its neighbors if going through this node yields a higher probability.
- **Termination**: The algorithm stops when we reach the end node.

### Code Implementation:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Solution {
    public double MaxProbability(int n, int[][] edges, double[] succProb, int start, int end) {
        // Adjacency list to represent the graph
        List<(int, double)>[] graph = new List<(int, double)>[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new List<(int, double)>();
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.Length; i++) {
            int u = edges[i][0];
            int v = edges[i][1];
            double prob = succProb[i];
            graph[u].Add((v, prob));
            graph[v].Add((u, prob));
        }

        // Max-heap to get the maximum probability path
        PriorityQueue<(int node, double prob), double> pq = 
            new PriorityQueue<(int node, double prob), double>(Comparer<double>.Create((a, b) => b.CompareTo(a)));
        pq.Enqueue((start, 1.0), 1.0);
        
        // To keep track of the maximum probability to reach each node
        double[] maxProb = new double[n];
        maxProb[start] = 1.0;
        
        while (pq.Count > 0) {
            var (current, curProb) = pq.Dequeue();
            
            if (current == end) return curProb;
            
            foreach (var (neighbor, edgeProb) in graph[current]) {
                double newProb = curProb * edgeProb;
                if (newProb > maxProb[neighbor]) {
                    maxProb[neighbor] = newProb;
                    pq.Enqueue((neighbor, newProb), newProb);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return 0.0;  // If there is no path from start to end
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each node's neighbors are stored with their corresponding edge probabilities.
2. **Priority Queue**: The priority queue (max-heap) is used to explore the most promising paths first (those with the highest probability).
3. **Relaxation**: For each node processed, we try to update the maximum probability to reach its neighbors. If we find a higher probability path to a neighbor, we update and push that neighbor into the queue.
4. **Early Exit**: If we reach the end node, we return the probability immediately.

This approach is efficient and works well for the given constraints. The use of Dijkstra's algorithm ensures that we efficiently find the path with the maximum probability in the graph.
