# Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks us to find pairs of indices (i, j) such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `(i * j) % k == 0`. In other words, we need to identify pairs of equal elements whose product of indices is divisible by `k`.

## Approach
The provided solution uses a brute force approach with two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) in the array. For each pair, it checks if the elements at those indices are equal (`nums[i] === nums[j]`) and if the product of the indices is divisible by `k` (`i * j % k === 0`). If both conditions are met, it increments the `count` variable.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: The solution uses two nested loops to iterate through all pairs of indices, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: The solution uses a constant amount of space, so the space complexity is O(1).

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPairs = function (nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] === nums[j] && i * j % k === 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Example
```javascript
const nums1 = [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3];
const k1 = 2;
console.log(countPairs(nums1, k1)); // Output: 4

const nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const k2 = 1;
console.log(countPairs(nums2, k2)); // Output: 0
```

This solution successfully solves the problem but is not the most efficient. There may be room for optimization by exploring alternative algorithms or data structures.
