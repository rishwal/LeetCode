# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes 

Given an `n x n` grid where each cell contains either a '/', '\', or a blank space ' ', we need to determine the number of distinct regions in the grid. The characters divide each square into regions, and we must count how many such regions exist after considering all divisions.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `grid = [" /","/ "]`
- **Output:** `2`
  
  The grid looks like:
  
  / 
 / 
  
  This grid has two distinct regions.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `grid = [" /","  "]`
- **Output:** `1`

  The grid looks like:
  
  / 
   
  
  This grid has only one region.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** `grid = ["/\\","\\/"]`
- **Output:** `5`

  The grid looks like:
  
  /\
  \/
  
  This grid has five distinct regions.

### Solution

The main idea behind solving this problem is to "expand" each cell of the grid into a 3x3 subgrid, representing each cell as a more detailed version where slashes and backslashes can be seen as dividing lines that form distinct regions.

**Steps:**

1. **Expand the grid:** Convert each `n x n` grid cell into a 3x3 grid:
   - `/` is represented by marking cells at `(0, 2)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 0)`.
   - `\` is represented by marking cells at `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`.
   - Blank spaces are left as is.
   
2. **Flood fill to count regions:** Use a flood fill algorithm (similar to DFS or BFS) to count connected components in the expanded grid.

3. **Return the count:** The number of distinct regions is the count of connected components found using flood fill.

### Code Implementation

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int RegionsBySlashes(string[] grid) {
        int n = grid.Length;
        int size = n * 3;
        int[,] expandedGrid = new int[size, size];

        // Expand the grid
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '/') {
                    expandedGrid[i * 3, j * 3 + 2] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 1, j * 3 + 1] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 2, j * 3] = 1;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == '\\') {
                    expandedGrid[i * 3, j * 3] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 1, j * 3 + 1] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 2, j * 3 + 2] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // Flood fill function
        void Fill(int x, int y) {
            if (x < 0 || x >= size || y < 0 || y >= size || expandedGrid[x, y] == 1) {
                return;
            }
            expandedGrid[x, y] = 1;
            Fill(x + 1, y);
            Fill(x - 1, y);
            Fill(x, y + 1);
            Fill(x, y - 1);
        }

        int regions = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                if (expandedGrid[i, j] == 0) {
                    Fill(i, j);
                    regions++;
                }
            }
        }

        return regions;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Grid Expansion:** 
   - Each character in the original grid is expanded into a 3x3 grid, allowing us to model the divisions more precisely.
   
2. **Flood Fill:**
   - We apply a flood fill to find all connected components in the expanded grid. Each connected component corresponds to a distinct region.

3. **Complexity:**
   - Time Complexity: The algorithm primarily relies on the flood fill, making the complexity approximately O((n * 3)²) = O(9n²).
   - Space Complexity: The space complexity is O((n * 3)²) due to the expanded grid.

### Summary

This approach effectively counts the distinct regions in the grid by transforming it into a more granular representation, followed by counting connected components using flood fill. The solution is efficient and handles the problem constraints well.
