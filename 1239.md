# 1239 Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of `arr` that has unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of `s`.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `arr = ["un","iq","ue"]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").

### Example 3:

**Input:** `arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]`  
**Output:** `26`  
**Explanation:** The only string in arr has all 26 characters.

## Solution

```csharp
class Solution {
    public int MaxLength(IList<string> arr) {
        List<int> dp = new List<int> { 0 };
        int res = 0;

        foreach (string s in arr) {
            int a = 0, dup = 0;

            foreach (char c in s) {
                dup |= a & (1 << (c - 'a'));
                a |= 1 << (c - 'a');
            }

            if (dup > 0) continue;

            for (int i = dp.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if ((dp[i] & a) > 0) continue;
                dp.Add(dp[i] | a);
                res = Math.Max(res, CountSetBits(dp[i] | a));
            }
        }

        return res;
    }

    private int CountSetBits(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            count += num & 1;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking:** The algorithm uses dynamic programming with bitmasking to keep track of the unique characters in each subsequence formed by concatenating strings from `arr`.

2. **Iterating Through Strings:** For each string `s` in `arr`, the algorithm iterates through its characters to identify unique characters and check for duplicates.

3. **Bitmasking:** The variable `a` is used as a bitmask to represent the set of unique characters encountered in the current string `s`. The variable `dup` is used to check for duplicates.

4. **Updating Dynamic Programming Table:** The algorithm iterates through the dynamic programming table (`dp`) to update it with new valid subsequences formed by concatenating the current string `s`. It checks for duplicates and updates the result accordingly.

5. **Counting Set Bits:** The function `CountSetBits` is used to count the number of set bits (1s) in a binary representation.

6. **Returning Result:** The final result is the maximum length of a concatenated string with unique characters.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the length of `arr`, and M is the maximum length of a string in `arr`. The algorithm iterates through each string and each character in the strings.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N * M), where N is the length of `arr`, and M is the maximum length of a string in `arr`. The dynamic programming table (`dp`) stores information about unique characters for each subsequence.
