## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

## Solution

```csharp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public ListNode next;
 *     public ListNode(int val=0, ListNode next=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.next = next;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode ReverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        
        return prev;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

To reverse a linked list iteratively, we need to maintain three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `nextTemp`. We start with `prev` pointing to `null` and `curr` pointing to the head of the list. In each iteration, we update the `next` pointer of `curr` to point to `prev`, move `prev` to `curr`, and `curr` to its next node (`nextTemp`). We continue this process until `curr` becomes `null`, at which point `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list, so we return `prev`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only constant extra space.
