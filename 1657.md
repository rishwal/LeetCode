# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

**Difficulty: Medium**

## Problem Description

Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- **Operation 1:** Swap any two existing characters.
  For example, abcde -> aecdb
- **Operation 2:** Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
  For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are close, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5
- word1 and word2 contain only lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CloseStrings(string word1, string word2) {
        if(word1.Length != word2.Length) return false;

        int[] frq1 = new int[26];
        int[] frq2 = new int[26];

        // Count the frequency of each character in both words
        for(int index=0; index<word1.Length; index++){
            frq1[word1[index] - 'a']++;
            frq2[word2[index] - 'a']++;
        }

        // Check if the set of characters is the same in both words
        for(int index=0; index<26; index++){
            if(frq1[index] == 0 && frq2[index] != 0)
                return false;
            if(frq1[index] != 0 && frq2[index] == 0)
                return false;
        }

        // Sort the frequency arrays to compare the frequency of each character
        Array.Sort(frq1);
        Array.Sort(frq2);

        // Check if the frequency arrays are equal
        return frq1.SequenceEqual(frq2);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Frequency Counting

- We create two arrays (`frq1` and `frq2`) of size 26 to represent the frequency of each character in the English alphabet.
- We iterate through each character in both words (`word1` and `word2`), incrementing the corresponding frequency in the arrays.

### Checking Character Sets

- After counting frequencies, we ensure that the set of characters in both words is the same.
- We check if a character is present in one word but not the other, returning `false` if there's a mismatch.

### Sorting Frequency Arrays

- We sort the frequency arrays to compare the frequency of each character.
- Sorting allows us to easily check if the frequencies of characters are the same in both words.

### Comparing Frequency Arrays

- We use `SequenceEqual` to compare the sorted frequency arrays.
- If the arrays are equal, it means that the frequency of each character is the same in both words.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of strings `word1` or `word2`.

### Conclusion

- The solution ensures that both words have the same set of characters with the same frequency, making them close.
