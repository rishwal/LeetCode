# LeetCode Daily Solutions 📝

This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode questions. I prefer to solve problems using C# and JavaScript. Each file in this repository is named with the question number on LeetCode.

## Structure

- Each file is named with the LeetCode question number (e.g., `1.md`).
- Each file includes the full LeetCode question, sample examples (test cases with output), and my approach to solving the problem (with detailed explanation).
- The time and space complexity of each solution are also provided.
