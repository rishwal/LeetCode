## 1544 Make The String Great 💡

### Question 🎯
Given a string `s` of lower and upper case English letters, a good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` where:
- `0 <= i <= s.length - 2`
- `s[i]` is a lower-case letter and `s[i + 1]` is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.

To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

### Example 1 ✅

**Input:** 
```python
s = "leEeetcode"
```
**Output:** 
`"leetcode"`
**Explanation:** 
In the first step, either you choose `i = 1` or `i = 2`, both will result `"leEeetcode"` to be reduced to `"leetcode"`.

### Example 2 ✅

**Input:** 
```python
s = "abBAcC"
```
**Output:** 
`""`
**Explanation:** 
We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
- `"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""`
- `"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""`

### Constraints 📏
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` contains only lower and upper case English letters.

### Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string MakeGood(string s) {
        Stack<char> stack = new Stack<char>();
        
        foreach (char c in s) {
            if (stack.Count > 0 && Math.Abs(stack.Peek() - c) == 32) {
                // If the current character and the top of the stack form a pair of bad characters, pop from the stack
                stack.Pop();
            } else {
                // Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack
                stack.Push(c);
            }
        }
        
        // Construct the result string from the remaining characters in the stack
        char[] result = new char[stack.Count];
        for (int i = stack.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[i] = stack.Pop();
        }
        
        return new string(result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation 📝
This solution utilizes a stack to remove adjacent characters that form bad pairs. It iterates through the string `s`, and for each character, it checks if it forms a bad pair with the character at the top of the stack. If it does, it removes both characters from the stack. Otherwise, it pushes the character onto the stack. Finally, it constructs the result string from the remaining characters in the stack and returns it.

### Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through each character of the string once.

### Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we use a stack to store characters from the string.
