# 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

- Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
- For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
- The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

### Example

```plaintext
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
```

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `nums.length` is even
- `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 10^5`
- `nums` consists of equal numbers of positive and negative integers.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[] RearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.Length;
        int[] output = new int[n];
        int i = 0, pos = 0, neg = 1;
        while (i < n) {
            if (nums[i++] > 0) {
                output[pos] = nums[i - 1];
                pos += 2;
            } else {
                output[neg] = nums[i - 1];
                neg += 2;
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution iterates through the input array `nums`.
- It maintains two pointers `pos` and `neg` to track the positions where positive and negative integers should be placed in the output array, respectively.
- While iterating through `nums`, if the current element is positive, it places it at position `pos` in the output array and increments `pos` by `2`.
- If the current element is negative, it places it at position `neg` in the output array and increments `neg` by `2`.
- This ensures that every consecutive pair of integers has opposite signs and the order of integers with the same sign is preserved.
