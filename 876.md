# 876 Middle of the Linked List 🏃‍♂️

## Question ❓
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Examples 🌟
Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

## Solution 💡

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public ListNode MiddleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slowPointer = head;
        ListNode fastPointer = head;

        while (fastPointer != null && fastPointer.next != null) {
            slowPointer = slowPointer.next;
            fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next;
        }

        return slowPointer;
    }
}
```

## Explanation 📝
This solution uses two pointers, slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.

## Time Complexity ⏰
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Both pointers traverse the list once.

## Space Complexity 🚀
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. 📊
