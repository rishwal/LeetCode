# 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `i`th flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets return `-1`.

### Example 1

**Input**: `bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2]`, `m = 3`, `k = 1`

**Output**: `3`

**Explanation**: Let us see what happened in the first three days. `x` means flower bloomed and `_` means flower did not bloom in the garden.
- We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
- After day 1: `[x, _, _, _, _]`   // we can only make one bouquet.
- After day 2: `[x, _, _, _, x]`   // we can only make two bouquets.
- After day 3: `[x, _, x, _, x]`   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.

### Example 2

**Input**: `bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2]`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`

**Output**: `-1`

**Explanation**: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return `-1`.

### Example 3

**Input**: `bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7]`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`

**Output**: `12`

**Explanation**: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
- After day 7: `[x, x, x, x, _, x, x]`
  - We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
- After day 12: `[x, x, x, x, x, x, x]`
  - It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.

### Constraints

- `bloomDay.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= m <= 10^6`
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we use a binary search approach combined with a helper function to determine the number of bouquets that can be made by a given day. The binary search helps in finding the minimum day efficiently.

### Steps

1. **Edge Case Check**: If `m * k` is greater than the length of `bloomDay`, return `-1` since it's impossible to form the required bouquets.
2. **Binary Search Initialization**: Initialize `start` to `0` and `end` to the maximum value in the `bloomDay` array.
3. **Binary Search**: Perform binary search to find the minimum day:
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `start` and `end`.
   - Use a helper function to count how many bouquets can be formed by day `mid`.
   - If the count is greater than or equal to `m`, update the answer and set `end` to `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, set `start` to `mid + 1`.
4. **Return Result**: Return the final answer.

### Helper Function

The helper function counts the number of bouquets that can be formed by a given day by iterating through the `bloomDay` array and counting adjacent bloomed flowers.

### Code

```csharp
using System;

public class Solution {
    public int MinDays(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        int n = bloomDay.Length;
        
        // If there are not enough flowers to make m bouquets, return -1
        if (m * k > n) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Initialize start to 0 and end to the maximum value in the array bloomDay
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        foreach (int day in bloomDay) {
            end = Math.Max(end, day);
        }
        
        int ans = -1;
        
        // Binary search
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (GetNumOfBouquets(bloomDay, mid, k) >= m) {
                ans = mid;
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }

    // Helper function to get the number of bouquets possible by day "day"
    private int GetNumOfBouquets(int[] bloomDay, int day, int k) {
        int numOfBouquets = 0;
        int flowers = 0;
        
        foreach (int bloom in bloomDay) {
            if (bloom <= day) {
                flowers++;
                if (flowers == k) {
                    numOfBouquets++;
                    flowers = 0;
                }
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return numOfBouquets;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Examples

#### Example 1

For `bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2]`, `m = 3`, `k = 1`:
- We need 3 bouquets each containing 1 flower.
- By day 3, we have enough flowers bloomed to make 3 bouquets: `[1, _, 3, _, 2]`.

#### Example 2

For `bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2]`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`:
- We need 3 bouquets each containing 2 flowers.
- We have only 5 flowers in total, so it is impossible to make 3 bouquets.

#### Example 3

For `bloomDay = [7, 7, 7, 7, 12, 7, 7]`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`:
- We need 2 bouquets each containing 3 flowers.
- By day 12, we have enough flowers bloomed to make 2 bouquets.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log D) where `D` is the maximum value in `bloomDay`. The binary search runs in O(log D) and each search iteration involves O(n) operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we use a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum number of days needed to make the required number of bouquets.
