# 2225 Find Players With Zero or One Losses

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winner_i, loser_i]` indicates that the player `winner_i` defeated player `loser_i` in a match.

Return a list `answer` of size 2 where:

- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

**Note:**
- You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
- The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.

## Example 1

**Input:**
```plaintext
matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
```

## Example 2

**Input:**
```plaintext
matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[[1,2,5,6],[]]
```

## Explanation:
1. Same steps as Example 1.
2. Since there are no players with exactly 1 loss in this case, `res[1]` is an empty list.

## Constraints

- `1 <= matches.length <= 105`
- `matches[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= winner_i, loser_i <= 105`
- `winner_i != loser_i`
- All matches[i] are unique.

## Solution 
```csharp

public class Solution {
    public IList<IList<int>> FindWinners(int[][] matches)
{
    Dictionary<int, int> loserCount = new Dictionary<int, int>();
    for (int i = 0; i < matches.Length; i++)
    {
        if (!loserCount.ContainsKey(matches[i][0]))
            loserCount.Add(matches[i][0], 0);

        if (!loserCount.ContainsKey(matches[i][1])) loserCount.Add(matches[i][1], 1);  
        else loserCount[matches[i][1]]++;
    }

    IList<IList<int>> res = new List<IList<int>>() {

     { loserCount.Where(dict => dict.Value == 0).Select(dict => dict.Key).Order().ToList() },
      { loserCount.Where(dict => dict.Value == 1).Select(dict => dict.Key).Order().ToList() }
    };

    return res;

    }
}

```

## Explanation:
1. We use a `Dictionary<int, int>` called `loserCount` to keep track of the count of losses for each player.
2. Loop through each match in `matches`.
3. For the winner of each match, increment the count of losses by 0 in `loserCount`. If the loser is not present in `loserCount`, add them with a loss count of 1.
4. Create the final result list `res`, where `res[0]` is players with 0 losses, and `res[1]` is players with 1 loss.
5. Use LINQ to filter players based on loss counts and order them in ascending order.
6. Return the result list `res`.


### Space Complexity Analysis:

1. **Dictionary (`loserCount`):**
   - The `loserCount` dictionary stores information about the number of losses for each player. The space complexity is O(M), where M is the number of unique players.

2. **Result Lists (`res[0]` and `res[1]`):**
   - The space required for the result lists depends on the number of players with 0 losses (M_0) and 1 loss (M_1). Therefore, the space complexity is O(M_0 + M_1).

3. **Additional Space (Variables):**
   - The algorithm uses a few additional variables, such as iterators and counters, which require constant space. The space complexity is O(1).

Overall, the space complexity is O(M), where M is the number of unique players.

In summary, the time complexity is O(N + M * log(M)), and the space complexity is O(M).
