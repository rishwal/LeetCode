# Problem 1255: Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters

## Problem Statement
Given a list of words, a list of single letters (which might be repeating), and the score of every character, return the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given letters. Each word in `words` can be used at most once.

The score of letters 'a', 'b', 'c', ... ,'z' is given by `score[0], score[1], ... , score[25]` respectively.

### Example 1
Input:
```
words = ["dog","cat","dad","good"], 
letters = ["a","a","c","d","d","d","g","o","o"], 
score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
```
Output:
```
23
```
Explanation:
- Score: a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2
- Using the letters, we can form the words "dad" (5+1+5) and "good" (3+2+2+5) for a total score of 23.

### Example 2
Input:
```
words = ["xxxz","ax","bx","cx"], 
letters = ["z","a","b","c","x","x","x"], 
score = [4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]
```
Output:
```
27
```
Explanation:
- Score: a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10
- Using the letters, we can form the words "ax" (4+5), "bx" (4+5), and "cx" (4+5) for a total score of 27.

### Example 3
Input:
```
words = ["leetcode"], 
letters = ["l","e","t","c","o","d"], 
score = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
```
Output:
```
0
```
Explanation:
- The word "leetcode" cannot be formed as the letter 'e' can only be used once.

### Constraints
- 1 <= words.length <= 14
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 15
- 1 <= letters.length <= 100
- letters[i].length == 1
- score.length == 26
- 0 <= score[i] <= 10
- words[i], letters[i] contain only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach
We can solve this problem using backtracking. We attempt to form words recursively, keeping track of the remaining letters and the current score. If a word can be formed with the available letters, we add its score to our total and continue forming the next word.

### Detailed Steps
1. Initialize an array `arr` to count the occurrences of each letter in `letters`.
2. Use a recursive function to explore all possible sets of words.
3. For each word, check if it can be formed with the available letters.
4. If the word can be formed, calculate the score and recursively call the function with the updated set of available letters.
5. Return the maximum score obtained by either including or excluding the current word.

### Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaxScoreWords(string[] words, char[] letters, int[] score) {
        int[] arr = new int[26];
        for(int i = 0; i < letters.Length; i++){
            arr[letters[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        return BC(words, arr, score, 0);
    }

    private int BC(string[] words, int[] letters, int[] scores, int i){
        if(i >= words.Length) return 0;
        int score = 0;
        int[] newLetters = new int[26];
        for(int j = 0; j < 26; j++){
            newLetters[j] = letters[j];
        }
        foreach(var c in words[i]){
            if(newLetters[c - 'a'] > 0){
                newLetters[c - 'a']--;
                score += scores[c - 'a'];
            }
            else{
                score = -1;
                break;
            }
        }
        int a = 0;
        if(score >= 0){
            a = score + BC(words, newLetters, scores, i + 1);
        }
        int b = BC(words, letters, scores, i + 1);
        return Math.Max(a, b);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(2^n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the average length of the words. This is because we are considering all subsets of words, and for each subset, we might need to check the formation of the word.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the length of the letters array. This space is used for the recursive stack and the letter count arrays.
