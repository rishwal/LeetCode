# LeetCode Problem 1335: Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the ith job is `jobDifficulty[i]`. You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days, where jobs are dependent (i.e., to work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i). You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day. Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs, return -1.

## Example

### Example 1:

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: 
First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6. 
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7

```

### Example 2:

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: 
If you finish a job per day, you will still have a free day. You cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.

```

### Example 3:

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The schedule is one job per day. The total difficulty will be 3.

```

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.Length;
        if (n < d) return -1;

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Array.Fill(dp, int.MaxValue / 2);
        dp[n] = 0;

        for (int day = 1; day <= d; day++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - day; i++) {
                int maxDifficulty = 0;
                dp[i] = int.MaxValue / 2;
                
                for (int j = i; j <= n - day; j++) {
                    maxDifficulty = Math.Max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[j]);
                    dp[i] = Math.Min(dp[i], maxDifficulty + dp[j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The function `MinDifficulty` takes an array of job difficulties (`jobDifficulty`) and an integer `d` as input.
- It initializes an array `dp` to store the minimum difficulty for each subproblem, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum difficulty to complete the jobs from `i` to `n`.
- It iterates over each day, and for each day, it iterates over each starting position `i` to calculate the minimum difficulty to complete the jobs for that day.
- It calculates the maximum difficulty for the current range and updates the `dp[i]` with the minimum difficulty considering the maximum difficulty for the current day.
- The final result is stored in `dp[0]`, which represents the minimum difficulty to complete all jobs in the given number of days.

This solution uses dynamic programming to optimize the calculation of minimum difficulty. The time complexity is O(d * n^2), where `n` is the length of the `jobDifficulty` array, and the space complexity is O(n).
