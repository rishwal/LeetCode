## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

### Example

```plaintext
Example 1:

Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

Example 2:

Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumSquares(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Array.Fill(dp, int.MaxValue);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            int min_val = int.MaxValue;
            for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; ++j) {
                min_val = Math.Min(min_val, dp[i - j * j] + 1);
            }
            dp[i] = min_val;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
