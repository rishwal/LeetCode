# 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can pick an index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length` and increment `nums[i]` by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in `nums` unique.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

### Example 1

**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 2]`

**Output**: `1`

**Explanation**: After 1 move, the array could be `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Example 2

**Input**: `nums = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7]`

**Output**: `6`

**Explanation**: After 6 moves, the array could be `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7]`.
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting will help us to manage duplicates easily.
2. **Iterate and Fix Duplicates**: Starting from the second element, check if the current element is not greater than the previous element. If it isn't, increment the current element to be one more than the previous element.
3. **Count the Moves**: Keep track of the number of increments required to make the current element unique.

### Steps

1. Sort the array.
2. Iterate through the sorted array.
3. If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, calculate the necessary increments to make it greater than the previous element.
4. Update the current element and add the increments to the total moves.

### Code

```csharp
using System;

public class Solution {
    public int MinIncrementForUnique(int[] nums) {
        // Sort the array
        Array.Sort(nums);
        
        int moves = 0;
        // Iterate through the array starting from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            // If the current element is not greater than the previous one
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                // Calculate the increment needed
                int increment = nums[i - 1] + 1 - nums[i];
                // Increment the current element to make it unique
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1;
                // Add the increment to the total moves
                moves += increment;
            }
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Example 1

For `nums = [1, 2, 2]`:
- After sorting: `[1, 2, 2]`
- We start checking from the second element:
  - `nums[2]` (which is `2`) is not greater than `nums[1]` (which is also `2`), so we increment `nums[2]` to `3`. Moves needed: `1`.
- The array becomes `[1, 2, 3]` after 1 move.

### Explanation of Example 2

For `nums = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7]`:
- After sorting: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 7]`
- We start checking from the second element:
  - `nums[1]` (which is `1`) is not greater than `nums[0]` (which is also `1`), so we increment `nums[1]` to `2`. Moves needed: `1`.
  - `nums[2]` (which is `2`) is now not greater than `nums[1]` (which is `2`), so we increment `nums[2]` to `3`. Moves needed: `1`.
  - `nums[3]` (which is `2`) is now not greater than `nums[2]` (which is `3`), so we increment `nums[3]` to `4`. Moves needed: `2`.
  - `nums[4]` (which is `3`) is now not greater than `nums[3]` (which is `4`), so we increment `nums[4]` to `5`. Moves needed: `2`.
- Total moves: `1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
- The array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are modifying the array in place and using a fixed amount of extra space for variables.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum number of moves to make every value in the array unique.
