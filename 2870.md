# Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of positive integers. There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

1. Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
2. Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is `nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4]`.
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is `nums = [3,3,4,3,4]`.
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is `nums = [4,4]`.
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is `nums = []`.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** It is impossible to empty the array.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public int MinOperations(int[] nums)
    {
        Dictionary<int, int> dict = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        for (int num=0; num<nums.Length;num++)
        {
            if (dict.ContainsKey(nums[num]))
            {
                dict[nums[num]]++;
            }
            else
            {
                dict[nums[num]] = 1;
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        foreach (var kvp in dict)
        {
            int t = kvp.Value;
            if (t == 1)
            {
                return -1;
            }
            count += t / 3;
            if (t % 3 != 0)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Initialize a dictionary `dict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.

2. **Counting Occurrences:** Iterate through each element in `nums` and count the occurrences using the dictionary `dict`.

3. **Calculating Operations:** Iterate through the dictionary and calculate the minimum number of operations required based on the occurrences of each element.

4. **Result:** Return the final count, representing the minimum number of operations to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is due to the iteration through the array to count the occurrences.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(K), where K is the number of distinct elements in the input array `nums`. This is due to the space used by the dictionary `dict`.
