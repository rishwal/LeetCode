# 446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence

**Difficulty: Hard**

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.  
For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.  
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].  
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: The arithmetic subsequences are:
- [2,4,6]
- [4,6,8]
- [6,8,10]
- [2,4,6,8]
- [4,6,8,10]
- [2,4,6,8,10]
- [2,6,10]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
```

## My Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int NumberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int length = nums.Length;
        int count = 0;

        // dp[i][difference] stores the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at index i with the given difference
        Dictionary<long, int>[] dp = new Dictionary<long, int>[length];

        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            dp[i] = new Dictionary<long, int>();
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < length; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                long difference = (long)nums[i] - nums[j];

                // If there is a valid subsequence ending at index j with the given difference,
                // update the count and the dp array for the current index i
                if (dp[j].TryGetValue(difference, out int subsequenceCount)) {
                    dp[i][difference] = dp[i].GetValueOrDefault(difference) + subsequenceCount;
                    count += subsequenceCount;
                }

                // Increment the count of subsequences at the current index i with the given difference
                dp[i][difference] = dp[i].GetValueOrDefault(difference) + 1;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution utilizes dynamic programming to keep track of the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index with a specific difference.
- The `dp` array is a 2D dictionary, where `dp[i][difference]` stores the count of subsequences ending at index `i` with the specified difference.
- The algorithm iterates through the array, calculating the difference between each pair of elements and updating the `dp` array accordingly.
- The count of arithmetic subsequences is maintained, and the final count is returned.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input array `nums`.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input array `nums`.
