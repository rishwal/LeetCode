# Count Sub Islands

## Problem Statement

You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2 containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.

An island in grid2 is considered a sub-island if there is an island in grid1 that contains all the cells that make up this island in grid2.

Return the number of islands in grid2 that are considered sub-islands.

### Example 1

**Input:** grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2. The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.

### Example 2

**Input:** grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2. The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.

### Constraints

- m == grid1.length == grid2.length
- n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 500
- grid1[i][j] and grid2[i][j] are either 0 or 1.

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int CountSubIslands(int[][] grid1, int[][] grid2) {
        int m = grid2.Length;
        int n = grid2[0].Length;
        int subIslandsCount = 0;

        // Directions array for moving up, down, left, and right
        int[][] directions = new int[][] {
            new int[] {0, 1},   // Right
            new int[] {1, 0},   // Down
            new int[] {0, -1},  // Left
            new int[] {-1, 0}   // Up
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // If the current cell in grid2 is land, check if it forms a sub-island
                if (grid2[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (BFS(grid1, grid2, i, j, directions)) {
                        subIslandsCount++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return subIslandsCount;
    }

    private bool BFS(int[][] grid1, int[][] grid2, int startX, int startY, int[][] directions) {
        int m = grid2.Length;
        int n = grid2[0].Length;
        Queue<int[]> queue = new Queue<int[]>();
        queue.Enqueue(new int[] { startX, startY });

        // Assume the current island is a sub-island unless proven otherwise
        bool isSubIsland = true;
        
        // Mark the starting cell as visited
        grid2[startX][startY] = 0;

        while (queue.Count > 0) {
            int[] cell = queue.Dequeue();
            int x = cell[0], y = cell[1];

            // If the corresponding cell in grid1 is not land, this island is not a sub-island
            if (grid1[x][y] == 0) {
                isSubIsland = false;
            }

            // Explore the 4 possible directions
            foreach (var dir in directions) {
                int newX = x + dir[0];
                int newY = y + dir[1];

                // If the new cell is within bounds and is land in grid2, explore it
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && grid2[newX][newY] == 1) {
                    queue.Enqueue(new int[] { newX, newY });
                    grid2[newX][newY] = 0; // Mark the cell as visited
                }
            }
        }

        return isSubIsland;
    }
}
Explanation
The solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore the islands in grid2 and checks if they are sub-islands in grid1. The BFS function explores the current island in grid2 and checks the corresponding cells in grid1. If any part of the island in grid2 does not match grid1, it is not considered a sub-island. The count of sub-islands is returned.

Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(m * n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is because each cell in grid2 is visited once during the BFS.

Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(m * n) for the queue used in the BFS, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. """
