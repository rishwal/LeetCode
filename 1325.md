# 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree `root` and an integer `target`, delete all the leaf nodes with value `target`. Note that once you delete a leaf node with value `target`, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value `target`, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

### Examples

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample_1_1684.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample_2_1684.png)

```
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
```

**Example 3:**

![Example 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample_3_1684.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3000]`.
- `1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we will perform a post-order traversal of the binary tree. This allows us to check and delete leaf nodes from the bottom up, ensuring that we correctly handle cases where a parent node becomes a leaf node with the target value after its children have been deleted.

Here is the detailed step-by-step approach:

1. **Post-order Traversal:** Traverse the tree in a post-order manner (left, right, root) so that we process leaf nodes first.
2. **Check and Delete Leaf Nodes:** If a node is a leaf and has the target value, delete it.
3. **Recurse Upwards:** After processing children, check the current node to see if it has become a leaf and should also be deleted.
4. **Return the Modified Tree:** If the root itself becomes a leaf with the target value, return `null`.

### Code Implementation

```csharp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public TreeNode RemoveLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        // Helper function to remove leaf nodes with target value
        TreeNode RemoveLeaf(TreeNode node) {
            if (node == null) return null;

            // Recursively remove from left and right subtrees
            node.left = RemoveLeaf(node.left);
            node.right = RemoveLeaf(node.right);

            // If current node is a leaf with target value, return null
            if (node.left == null && node.right == null && node.val == target) {
                return null;
            }

            return node;
        }

        // Start removing from the root
        return RemoveLeaf(root);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **RemoveLeaf Function:** This helper function recursively processes each node in a post-order manner.
2. **Base Case:** If the node is `null`, simply return `null`.
3. **Recursive Case:** Recursively call `RemoveLeaf` on the left and right children.
4. **Leaf Check:** If the current node becomes a leaf (both children are `null`) and its value equals the target, return `null` to delete it.
5. **Return the Result:** Finally, return the modified tree starting from the root.

This solution ensures that all leaf nodes with the target value are removed, and any new leaves formed as a result of deletions are also checked and removed if necessary.
