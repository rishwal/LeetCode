# LeetCode 1897: Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `words` (0-indexed).

In one operation, pick two distinct indices `i` and `j`, where `words[i]` is a non-empty string, and move any character from `words[i]` to any position in `words[j]`.

Return true if you can make every string in `words` equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]`

**Output:** `true`

**Explanation:** Move the first 'a' in `words[1]` to the front of `words[2]`, to make `words[1] = "abc"` and `words[2] = "abc"`. All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `words = ["ab","a"]`

**Output:** `false`

**Explanation:** It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var makeEqual = function (words) {
    let wholeStr = words.join('');

    const charMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < wholeStr.length; i++) {
        if (charMap.has(wholeStr[i])) {
            charMap.set(wholeStr[i], charMap.get(wholeStr[i]) + 1);
        } else {
            charMap.set(wholeStr[i], 1);
        }
    }

    for (let count of charMap.values()) {
        if (count % words.length !== 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
};
```

## Explanation

The given solution aims to determine if it's possible to make all strings in the `words` array equal by redistributing characters using the provided operation. The algorithm works by counting the occurrences of each character in the concatenated string of all words. If the count of any character is not divisible evenly by the number of words, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the total number of characters in all words combined. The algorithm iterates through each character once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(U), where U is the number of unique characters in the concatenated string. The algorithm uses a Map to store the count of each unique character.
