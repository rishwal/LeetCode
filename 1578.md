# LeetCode 1578: Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

## Problem Description

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where `colors[i]` is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```

### Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
```

### Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the balloons at indices 0 and 4. Each balloon takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

## Solutions
### C#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinCost(string colors, int[] neededTime) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < colors.Length; i++)
        {
            if (colors[i] == colors[i - 1])
            {
                res += Math.Min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
                neededTime[i] = Math.Max(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

## Javascript
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} colors
 * @param {number[]} neededTime
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCost = function (colors, neededTime) {
    let res = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < colors.length ; i++)
    {
        if (colors[i] == colors[i - 1]) {
            res += Math.min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
            neededTime[i] = Math.max(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```

## Explanation

The solution iterates through the array of colors and needed times, checking for consecutive balloons of the same color. If found, it removes one of them and accumulates the minimum time needed. The final result is the minimum time required to make the rope colorful.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `colors`. The space complexity is O(1) as there is no additional space used based on the input size.
