# 150 Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression and return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

### Note:

- The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

### Example

```plaintext
Example 1:

Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:

Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:

Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4
- tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200]

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int EvalRPN(string[] tokens)
    {
        Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();

        foreach (var token in tokens)
        {
            if (int.TryParse(token, out int num))
            {
                stack.Push(num);
            }
            else
            {
                int operand2 = stack.Pop();
                int operand1 = stack.Pop();

                switch (token)
                {
                    case "+":
                        stack.Push(operand1 + operand2);
                        break;
                    case "-":
                        stack.Push(operand1 - operand2);
                        break;
                    case "*":
                        stack.Push(operand1 * operand2);
                        break;
                    case "/":
                        stack.Push(operand1 / operand2);
                        break;
                    default:
                        throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid operator: " + token);
                }
            }
        }

        return stack.Pop();
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Algorithm:** The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of operands as it iterates through the input tokens.

2. **Processing Tokens:** For each token in the input array, the algorithm checks if it's an operand or an operator.

   - If it's an operand (a number), the algorithm pushes it onto the stack.
   - If it's an operator, the algorithm pops the top two operands from the stack, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.

3. **Switch Statement:** The switch statement handles the different cases for operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). It throws an exception if the token is an invalid operator.

4. **Final Result:** The final result is the only element left on the stack after processing all tokens.
