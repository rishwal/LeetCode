# 938. Range Sum of BST

**Difficulty: Easy**

## Problem Description

Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23
Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 10^4].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- 1 <= low <= high <= 10^5
- All Node.val are unique.

## My Solution

```csharp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public int RangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) 
            return 0;

        int sum = 0;
        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) 
            sum += root.val;
        
        sum += RangeSumBST(root.left, low, high);
        sum += RangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);

        return sum;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The solution uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary search tree.
- For each node, it checks if the node value is within the given range [low, high].
- If the node value is within the range, it adds the value to the `sum`.
- Recursively calls the function for the left and right subtrees to continue the traversal.
- The final `sum` represents the total sum of values within the specified range.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary search tree.
