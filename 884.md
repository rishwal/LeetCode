# 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

## Problem Statement

A sentence is a string of single-space-separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears **exactly once** in one of the sentences and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `s1 = "this apple is sweet"`, `s2 = "this apple is sour"`
- **Output:** `["sweet", "sour"]`
- **Explanation:** The word "sweet" appears only in `s1`, while the word "sour" appears only in `s2`.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `s1 = "apple apple"`, `s2 = "banana"`
- **Output:** `["banana"]`
- **Explanation:** The word "banana" appears only in `s2` and "apple" appears more than once in `s1`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `s1` and `s2` do not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s1` and `s2` are separated by a single space.

## Solution

The idea is to count the occurrences of each word in both sentences and identify the words that appear exactly once across both sentences.

### Approach
1. Split both sentences `s1` and `s2` into arrays of words.
2. Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each word in both arrays.
3. Iterate over the dictionary to find words that have a count of exactly 1.
4. Return those words as the result.

### Code
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string[] UncommonFromSentences(string s1, string s2) {
        List<string> ans = new List<string>();
        Dictionary<string, int> dict = new Dictionary<string, int>();
        
        // Split both sentences into arrays of words
        string[] dict1 = s1.Split(' ');
        string[] dict2 = s2.Split(' ');
        
        // Count occurrences of words in the first sentence
        foreach (var word in dict1) {
            if (dict.ContainsKey(word))
                dict[word]++;
            else
                dict[word] = 1;
        }
        
        // Count occurrences of words in the second sentence
        foreach (var word in dict2) {
            if (dict.ContainsKey(word))
                dict[word]++;
            else 
                dict[word] = 1;
        }
        
        // Find words that have a count of exactly 1
        foreach (var (key, val) in dict) {
            if (val == 1)
                ans.Add(key);
        }
        
        return ans.ToArray();
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2`. We traverse all words in both sentences.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n + m)` to store the count of each word in the dictionary.

### Explanation
1. Split the input strings `s1` and `s2` into words.
2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the number of occurrences of each word.
3. Traverse through the dictionary and collect words that appear exactly once.
4. Convert the list of uncommon words to an array and return it.

### Example Walkthrough
- **Example 1:**
  - `s1 = "this apple is sweet"`, `s2 = "this apple is sour"`
  - Words from `s1`: `["this", "apple", "is", "sweet"]`
  - Words from `s2`: `["this", "apple", "is", "sour"]`
  - Dictionary counts: 
    - "this": 2, "apple": 2, "is": 2, "sweet": 1, "sour": 1
  - Uncommon words: `["sweet", "sour"]`
- **Example 2:**
  - `s1 = "apple apple"`, `s2 = "banana"`
  - Words from `s1`: `["apple", "apple"]`
  - Words from `s2`: `["banana"]`
  - Dictionary counts: 
    - "apple": 2, "banana": 1
  - Uncommon words: `["banana"]`
