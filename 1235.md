# Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling

## Problem Description

We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time X, you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]`  
**Output:** `120`  
**Explanation:** The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. Time range [1-3]+[3-6], we get a profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]`  
**Output:** `150`  
**Explanation:** The subset chosen is the first, fourth, and fifth job. Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

### Example 3:

**Input:** `startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]`  
**Output:** `6`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    private Dictionary<int, int> dp;

    public int JobScheduling(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int[] profit) {
        int[][] jobs = new int[startTime.Length][];
        for (int i = 0; i < startTime.Length; i++) {
            jobs[i] = new int[] { startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i] };
        }
        Array.Sort(jobs, (a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

        dp = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        return Dfs(0, jobs);
    }

    private int Dfs(int cur, int[][] jobs) {
        if (cur == jobs.Length) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (dp.ContainsKey(cur)) {
            return dp[cur];
        }

        int next = FindNext(cur, jobs);
        int inclProf = jobs[cur][2] + (next == -1 ? 0 : Dfs(next, jobs));
        int exclProf = Dfs(cur + 1, jobs);

        dp[cur] = Math.Max(inclProf, exclProf);
        return dp[cur];
    }

    int FindNext(int cur, int[][] jobs) {
        for (int next = cur + 1; next < jobs.Length; next++) {
            if (jobs[next][0] >= jobs[cur][1]) {
                return next;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Convert the input arrays into a 2D array `jobs` for easy sorting. Sort the `jobs` array based on the start time.

2. **Dynamic Programming:** Initialize a dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems. Use a recursive function `Dfs` to calculate the maximum profit.

3. **Recursive Function:** The function `Dfs` considers two cases:
   - Including the current job in the subset and recursively calling the function for the next non-overlapping job.
   - Excluding the current job and recursively calling the function for the next job.

4. **Memoization:** Memoize the results of subproblems using the `dp` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

5. **Find Next Non-overlapping Job:** The function `FindNext` finds the next non-overlapping job index for a given job.

6. **Result:** Return the maximum profit obtained from the `Dfs` function.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N log N), where N is the number of jobs. This is due to the sorting of the jobs array.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of jobs. This is due to the space used by the `dp` dictionary.
