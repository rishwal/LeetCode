# 645 Set Mismatch

## Problem Description

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,2,4]`  
**Output:** `[2,3]`  
**Explanation:** The duplicated number is 2, and the missing number is 3.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,1]`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  
**Explanation:** The duplicated number is 1, and the missing number is 2.

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[] FindErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        Dictionary<int, int> count = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        int repeatedNumber = 0;
        int expectedSum = nums.Length * (nums.Length + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;

        foreach (int num in nums) {
            if (count.ContainsKey(num)) {
                repeatedNumber = num;
            }
            else {
                count[num] = 1;
                actualSum += num;
            }
        }

        int missingNumber = expectedSum - actualSum;

        return new int[] { repeatedNumber, missingNumber };
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Counting and Summation:** The algorithm uses a dictionary (`count`) to keep track of the occurrences of each number in the array (`nums`). It also calculates the expected sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` and computes the actual sum of the elements in the array.

2. **Finding Repeated and Missing Numbers:** While iterating through the array, if a number is already present in the `count` dictionary, it is the repeated number. The missing number is then calculated as the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.

3. **Returning Result:** The algorithm returns an array containing the repeated and missing numbers.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates through the array once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm uses a dictionary (`count`) to store the occurrences of numbers in the array.
