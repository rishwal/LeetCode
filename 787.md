# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
## Problem
There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

## Example
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 100
- 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
- flights[i].length == 3
- 0 <= fromi, toi < n
- fromi != toi
- 1 <= pricei <= 10^4
- There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
- 0 <= src, dst, k < n
- src != dst

## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindCheapestPrice(int n, int[][] flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Array.Fill(dp, int.MaxValue);
        dp[src] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            int[] temp = (int[])dp.Clone();
            foreach (int[] flight in flights) {
                if (dp[flight[0]] != int.MaxValue) {
                    temp[flight[1]] = Math.Min(temp[flight[1]], dp[flight[0]] + flight[2]);
                }
            }
            dp = temp;
        }
        
        return dp[dst] == int.MaxValue ? -1 : dp[dst];
    }
}
